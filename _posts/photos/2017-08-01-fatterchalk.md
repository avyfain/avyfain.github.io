    caption: The first band to play was More Fatter. They happen to be friends with my friend George, so I had seen perform them before.

    caption: Next up was Sidewalk Chalk. I had never heard of them. Since I am not a big hip hop fan, I knew I would have mixed feelings about their music, but the lyrics were good, and they put on a really good show.

    caption: The band is from Chicago, and their lyrics are very political. This was right before a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb_lw4LeyDY">song about police brutality</a>, and how it disproportionately affects young black men. The song never says the main character is black, but we all assume it.
