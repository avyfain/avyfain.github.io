    caption: On our way to the Airbnb, our driver mentioned there was an art fair in San Felipe. We were staying a few blocks over in Quinta Camacho and decided to walk there.

    caption: As usual, people were surprised that I asked to take their photos, but in general they were less shy than in other places I've visited.

    caption: We went up Monserrate, and got rained on on the way down. It was only 10,000 feet of elevation.

    caption: The next morning, before work, we headed downtown to do a self-guided walking tour. We used Voicemap, and it reminded us of how sad it is that Detour is no longer around.

    caption: This one was too weird to not share.

    caption: Visiting the Museo Nacional was a disappointing experience. The exhibits were set up in a very disorganized way, and the content seemed to be copy pasted from academic research. They had cool artifacts, but the incoherent passages and inaccessible language meant to impress people with their big words didn't impress me.

    caption: The biking infrastructure was cool, particularly for a Latin American city, but I wasn't as impressed as I expected to be after hearing about it for years.

    caption: My friend Alicia recommended that we go to Leo, and it was one of the best parts of the trip. Having such a good meal at this price was too good to pass up. I had no idea what half the things we were eating were, but they were extremely tasty.

    caption: The Inquisition Museum was not great, but it was good to get a bit of Colombian history. Unfortunately we were in a rush at the end and missed the bit about their fight for independence, which I assume I would have enjoyed.

    caption: The narrow streets with their funky architecture felt like a mix of New Orleans and the old Italian towns [we visited](https://faingezicht.com/photos/2021/12/02/italia-revisited/) a couple of years ago. I've never been to Spain, but I assume I'd compare it to that instead if I had the reference.

    caption: To get to the actual wedding we took a boat. It broke down halfway through and we had to go back to shore to switch boats. It made the trip longer, but we had beers and cool views, so I had no complaints.

In December, my friends Debbie and Iacov were getting married in Cartagena, so Hannah and I decided to make a trip out of it and work remotely from Bogotá a few days ahead of the wedding. I'm sad I didn't get a photo of the two of them.

In Bogotá we got to hike, see a few museums, eat good food, and meet up with old friends (Goldy and Jonny made great hosts). Cartagena was a whirlwind, but luckily we also got to explore a bit.

A roll of Lomochrome Metropolis, a Cinestill 400D, and also my digital camera made the trip a fun photo trek. You for sure can tell which shots below came from which medium.
