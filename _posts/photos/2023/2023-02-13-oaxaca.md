We traveled to Oaxaca for our friend Andres' wedding. He was one of the few other Costa Ricans at Northwestern when we were in college, so to me his wedding felt like a strange mix of college reunion and a party with old friends from home.

Oaxaca felt touristy, but not nearly as much as some other cities we've visited recently. The food was amazing, and as a fan of mezcal I had a lot of really good drinks to pair it with.

The colors made for great photography. I received some film as gifts for the holidays, so I took a roll of Lomography 400 courtesy of my friend Maizie, and a roll of Fujifilm 200 (which I experimented with and pushed up a stop) courtesy of Hannah's cousin Grant. I also brought my DSLR, which I only used during our longer excursion day.
