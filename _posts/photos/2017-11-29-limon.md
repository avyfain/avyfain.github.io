description: I was just in Costa Rica for my brother's wedding. The trip was amazing, but somehow I only ended up taking photos when we went to the beach. It was my first time in the Caribbean side of the country, and we had a lot of fun.

    caption: The drive from San Jos√© is long, so we got there late in the afternoon, just in time for a sunset walk along the beach.

    caption: As soon as we got there, we saw the dead fish. No one had an explanation, but hundreds if not thousands of these little puffers were all over the coast.

    caption: The way the light hit the ocean lent itself to many texture experiments.

    caption: We went to the [Jaguar Rescue Center](http://www.jaguarrescue.foundation/) and met Pistachio. Ironically, they have no jaguars.

    caption: After several trips to Costa Rica, Hannah finally met a sloth. After crying when she saw one through binoculars last time, being 10 feet away from this guy and slightly freaking out didn't seem that emotional.

    caption: We walked back to our hotel to pick up the car and go to Manzanillo.

    caption: There were some really cool views, but my expectations were also very high. Overall, I think it is more worth it to visit [Manuel Antonio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Antonio_National_Park), on the Pacific coast, than the Southern Caribbean.
