It has been a crazy few months. Yesterday and today were rough days.

Tonight, as I was preparing dinner at Hannah's, we suddenly heard a ton of noise outside. We knew it was a protest, and decided to go see the what was happening around 24th Street BART. We ended up walking all the way to City Hall.

All ages, all races, all genders. People cried. People hugged strangers. People empathized.

How amazing is San Francisco?
