    caption: "Similar to Ellis Island in the East Coast, Angel Island was an immigration center during the early 20th century. Now, there is a museum and a few outdoor pieces about the institutional racism and xenophobia of the time where the detention facility used to be. One wishes this kind of discrimination were anachronistic, and long over, but it is easy to relate these conflicting narratives about freedom to the present. <br>Sadly fitting for the week that followed. The U.S. is a strange country."

    caption: "Next weekend, I was invited to Alamere Falls. We were a large group (almost 20!) from all over Latin America. Sadly, I didn't take pictures of the people I hiked with. It's hard when everyone is walking."

Summer in San Francisco is great. On most days, the city gets cold and foggy, so it is better to stay inside. Luckily, an hour or two away there are endless warm options to get away to. I definitely took advantage of it these past weeks.
