    caption: "I'm still amazed at the used bookstores in Mexico City. They skew towards way older and tattered tomes than most shops Iâ€™ve visited in cities across the US, Latin America, and Europe. Why? Macro/growth would make me expect the opposite: more volume of recent editions of books as people have higher levels of education and purchasing power today than when the old editions would have come out."

Just days after a short [trip to Mexico earlier this year](/photos/2022/03/06/cdmx/) my friend Nathan got engaged, and gave me a good reason to go back to the city for his wedding. It was cool to go back and feel mostly oriented in the neighborhoods where we'd hung out last time. My brother happened to be there for a different friend's wedding that same week, we talked our friend Amol into tagging along for a few days, and I got to see many old friends at the wedding, which made it a great experience.

Below are most of two black and white rolls I shot during the trip.
