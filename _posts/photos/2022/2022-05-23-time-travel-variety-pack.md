One of the curious things about shooting film is that it's warped the way I think about time and place. I used to be able to map the trips I took and the things I did fairly linearly to the photos I'd take out of my DSLR – lined with metadata and GPS tags. Film isn't like that. Rolls are started and half finished in one place, then continued halfway across the world a month or two later. By the time I drop them off at the shop, I have no idea what they will develop for me. It's kinda like time travel.

This set has been brewing for a while, and mixes a few rolls of film from different places along with digital shots.
