    caption: Walking on Unter den Linden was strangely emotional. Just being there and reading the street signs made me think of my mom singing [a song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAkTiPMz4ik) that her grandpa used to sing to her and about the counterfactual lives her mom's family could have continued to live there.

    caption: Here I'm cheating. This was an iPhone photo. I love the mix of cultures in big European cities. Oddly, Berlin felt less cosmopolitan than I remembered it, but maybe it was just the contrast with Paris.

After a quick visit to [Paris](/photos/2022/09/19/paris22/) we flew to Berlin. A few of our friends moved there during the pandemic, and I am glad I got to see them in their new habitat.

Visiting Berlin is full of mixed feelings for me. I love the culture and the vibrancy but obviously I also associate it with my family's dislocation, hardship, and loss.

I hadn't been there in 10 years and had high expectations coming in, remembering how much I enjoyed my time living in Germany back in 2012.
