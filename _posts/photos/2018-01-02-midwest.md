    caption: We started off in Indianapolis, and we stayed for a night at our friend Sarah's. She lives downtown in an area that reminds me a lot of SoMa in San Francisco, with old buildings right next to new condos, and lots of office buildings, including their very own Salesforce Tower. This isn't it.

    caption: I haven't read much Vonnegut, but for some reason it seems like he would not have liked to have a painting of himself on the side of some random parking lot.

    caption: While at this restaurant I kept thinking about the now famous [Cheesecake Factory Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/MaxKriegerVG/status/931373170791198720/), and our conversations later kept going back to Venkatesh Rao's [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/). This was a recurring theme of the trip, and it didn't feel great to notice [that](https://twitter.com/avyfain/status/944402608629927936) about myself.

    caption: These three made me take twenty photos from different angles, so I felt like I had to post at least one one.

    caption: "Sarah took us to the hipster side of town: Fletcher Place. The signature drink at this coffee shop was a very strange capuccino with honey and cayenne. I liked it, but probably wouldn't order it again."

    caption: The fact that we can stay at Hannah's grandma's condo downtown is always very convenient, and makes for some great city shots.

    caption: I had a meeting near the Chicago Cultural Center, and they were hosting the Architecture Biennial, so I walked in. It looked awesome, so I made Hannah come back with me the next day and do a tour.

    caption: Hannah's grandma took us out to dinner, and the decorations at the restaurant were pretty strange.

    caption: Back at the Biennial. There were some [seriously awesome pieces](http://chicagoarchitecturebiennial.org/participants/). Some of my favorite were Cameron Wu's [Baroque Machinations](https://vimeo.com/96957388), Charles Waldheim and Siena Scarf Design's [Heliomorphic Chicago](http://www.metropolismag.com/architecture/heliomorphic-chicago-biennial/), Filip Dujardin's [Chicago](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brulelaker/37171024911/in/photostream/) [Shuffle](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brulelaker/37171025031/in/photostream/) photos (which I could not find better links to, sorry), Dogma's [The Room of Oneâ€™s Own](https://www.drawingmatter.org/sets/portfolios/dogma/), and the various aritsts who participated in Vertical City (pictured).

    caption: As you circled the building, you got different views from this internal courtyard. The reflections on the windows made it a trippy experience.

    caption: "Then we went back out to the cold. This was our one \"warm\" day: 15F/10C. Regardless of the weather, I made a point to walk up and down the city. Walking past the Trump Tower on Michigan Ave. (a few blocks north from where I took this photo) still feels dystopian. I am sad the city was never able to make them take down the sign."

We spent the holiday break with Hannah's family in Indianapolis and Chicago, and got to see a bunch of friends while we were there, too. As expected, it was cold, and it was fun.
