    caption: The temples are all packed, and the plazas in front of them seem to be used as third places where people just hang out.

    caption: I really enjoyed the scale of the streets, with their tight sidewalks and arcades. I was especially surprised that many of them don't have raised sidewalks, and instead just have a stripe painted-on, as if for a bike lane.

    caption: The Ximen Red House market was less interesting than I expected, but the political backdrop of it being a remnant of Japanese colonial rule turned into an icon of the local LGBT community made it an interesting stop on our tour.

    caption: Hearing our tour guide tell the story behind the rename of [228 Peace Memorial Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228_Peace_Memorial_Park) and the waves of political unrest and civil wars in the country made us realize the tour we were on was on some degree a vehicle for propaganda. Our guide was a filmmaker, and actually had a crew come meet us at this spot to film his explanation. I happen to agree with their stance (ie, Taiwan should be independent) but that was a very strange realization an hour into the tour.

    caption: Our friends who had been there before insisted we should go to Addiction Aquatic. The fish market didn't disappoint. Their sushi was delicious, and we also had some of the best spot prawns I've ever had. I was so excited about the prawns that Hannah couldn't stop laughing at me.

On our way back from [Thailand](/photos/2024/04/12/tailandia/), we made a pit stop in Taiwan. Hannah initially wanted to stop in Singapore, but I insisted that we might not have a chance to visit Taiwan again if we didn't go this time around. Walking around Taipei, you could never tell that it's the capital of a country under such a contentious political situation.

While traveling in Thailand made me think of religion and spirituality, Taiwan made me think of politics and history. I don't think I can understand Taiwan without first understanding China. I had Frank Dik√∂tter's [The People's Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Dik%C3%B6tter#The_People's_Trilogy) on the list, and added Graham Peck's Two Kinds of Time to the queue on this trip. Now I actually have to read them.

We stayed in the Da'an neighborhood, and really enjoyed the vibe of city life there. I really hope we get a chance to go back.
