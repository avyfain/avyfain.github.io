    caption: We wanted to make the most of the little time we had left when we arrived, so we headed over to Baan Kang Wat, an artisan crafts market.

    caption: The little food stalls looked delicious, but we had a big breakfast, so I only had coffee.

    caption: We walked from there to Wat Umong. Thailand is littered with ancient temples, so it was hard to pick, but we were already on the West side of the city and took advantage of it. The temple has been there since 1297.

    caption: After the wedding events were over, we went to Phuket. Walking to the beach from our place was a bit tricky given the lack of sidewalks.

    caption: All the longboats have one of these old exposed engines attached in the back. It's an interesting approach.

    caption: And then there were the elephants. It's odd that merely being a few feet away from these guys felt so special. We missed our originally scheduled tour, but were luckily able to find a different sanctuary that would take us.

    caption: Spending time immersed in such a different culture, and the centrality of religion in city life there made we want to bump _A History of Religious Ideas_ by Mircea Eliade way up in my reading queue. I'm hoping to read the first volume later this year.

    caption: Wat Pho, the [Temple of the Reclining Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Pho), is as impressive and disorienting as you'd expect with its 46 meter long statue.

    caption: We crossed the river three or four times on different boats that day.

    caption: Our cocktail bar experiences were hit or miss, even though we tried following the 50 Best Bars recommendations. There were a bunch more in our list we didn't get to try. We showed up to Mahaniyom right as they were opening for the night. It was good.

    caption: The river at night, during our bike tour through the city. We biked with Co Van Kessel tours, which markets itself as showing you the "real Bangkok," and it really felt like they delivered on their promise. We went through tiny alleys and night markets far from the touristy areas. Very much recommended.

    caption: Everyone rides motorcycles. Instead of Uber or Lyft, the popular transportation app there is Grab which has like 10 different modalities. For example, you can get a driver to come pick you up in their scooter, and you sit behind them as they zip through the city. It's a bit scary, but fun.

Our friends Nikhil and Rachel got married in Thailand at the end of December, and we were lucky to be able to travel and celebrate with them. Less lucky was our experience flying in from SFO, which included a 36 hour delay, many hours on the phone with awful customer service reps, and missing the first event of the wedding. Lesson learned - **never** fly China Airlines.

We got to explore less of Chiang Mai than we wanted to, but the trip as a whole was great. We also got to visit Phuket and Bangkok while in Thailand, and spent a few days in Taiwan on the way back. Somehow I ended up with zero photos of the bride and groom.
