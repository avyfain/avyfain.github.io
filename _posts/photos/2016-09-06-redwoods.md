For my birthday, Hannah bought us a tent and a couple of sleeping bags. This past weekend we got to use them for the first time at Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It was a lot of fun.

In honor of the occasion, and because I am slowly contracting [gear acquisition syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GreyCat/Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome), I got myself a new 50mm f/1.4. The blur quality is amazing, but I am still not used to the focal length. Below is a mix of photos taken with that one, and the 24mm.
