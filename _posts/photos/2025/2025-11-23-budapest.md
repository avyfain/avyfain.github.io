Following our [Vienna visit](/photos/2025/11/17/wien/), we headed to Budapest. We could immediately tell Budapest was the poorer sibling. It felt a lot more run down, but the city is still beautiful, has a lot of history, great wine, and many things to see and do.

I wanted to take a boat from Vienna, but instead we took a train ride - I fumbled the departure time, and we had to play musical chairs on the way. Once there, we doubled down on the rocky start with an Airbnb without hot water and a less than ideal layout, but we moved to a hotel and from then on had a great time.

For some reason, I took a lot of vertical shots there.
