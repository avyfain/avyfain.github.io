    caption: We stayed in a big Airbnb on Schottenring. Guessing by the attire of the people on the street, lots of finance/law offices were in the area between us and the downtown Innere-Stadt.

    caption: Hannah almost killed me with this [_compose and wait_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxoYxZpujbc&t=201s). We probably stood there for 10 minutes.

    caption: Everyone was walking around with these little sticks, which seemed pretty odd. I asked our tour guide, and it turns out there's a tradition to make a bundle of hazel twigs (_palmbuschen_) and get it blessed by the priest to hang at home to protect against evil spirits.

    caption: The whole gang at the castle gardens. Growing up, my mom loved Princess Sisi, and half the point of going to Vienna was to see the castle where she lived and all the Sisi memorabilia. The museum wasn't great, but the gardens were beautiful.

    caption: I asked this guy at the Naschmarkt to take his photo, framed it, and someone called him just a second before I pressed the shutter. The photo ended up being better than I had planned, though I wish I had a slower shutter speed for the full effect.

    caption: I remember really enjoying the Secession museum when [we visited in 2020](/photos/2020/01/23/europa-ii/). I was sad we didn't have enough time to go this time around.

    caption: I went on a long walk up a hill by myself near the university to go to a coffee shop. The walk was nice, but the coffee wasn't really worth it.

    caption: I have taken this photo in many cities. It's a classic angle with my 35mm.

Earlier this year, together with my brothers and their families, we booked a trip to Vienna and followed it up with a few days in Budapest. This was the first time we were all on a vacation together in a long time. After years of asking for it, my mom finally got her wish to do a big family trip where no one was working part time. 

We took a lot of photos on everyone's cell phones, but I brought my film camera and did my usual street photography thing. Results below. I also got a disposable camera for each of my nephews and nieces (yes, even the 2 year old). Those I'm keeping out of the blog but needless to say, they were a lot of fun to look through.
