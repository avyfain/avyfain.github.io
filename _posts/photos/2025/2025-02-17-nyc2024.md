    caption: I'm super curious about the regulation of who gets to sell Christmas trees on street corners in New York. I'm sure there's a good local politics corruption and permitting story there.

    caption: Zach and I were supposed to get breakfast one day. I thought it was a different day than he did. My bad. Since he got me out of the house early, at least I was able to take a bunch of photos of the city waking up.

    caption: We went to a few great cocktail bars, too. This is Martiny's. The drinks were really good, but we felt we were just being rushed out as soon as we got seated.

    caption: We finally visited the Guggenheim. I was underwhelmed by the art, but loved the building. So many cool lines. Having Roman Mars in my ear while walking around the museum was a nice touch, too.

In December, I went to NYC for work. I'm excited that with my new job I have a reason to travel there a couple of times a year. Beyond meeting a few of my coworkers, this time, I got to catch up with a few friends, snuck in a Comedy Cellar show and a Broadway musical (thanks Zack for the rec!), and even a museum visit. It was cold, but we had a great time.

Hannah's dad had found some old very expired film while cleaning out their house, and gave it to Hannah, who let me test it out. This set is mostly shot on that stock. It was my first time shooting with decade-plus expired film, and was a bit worried about the results. The colors are pretty cool, though a bit faded. It was a fun experiment.
