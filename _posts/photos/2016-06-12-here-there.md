    caption: A couple of friends and I started an "Article Club," and today was our first meeting. We talked about <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/twitter-is-betting-everything-on-jack-dorsey">this</a>, and decided that from now on, what we read can't be about tech. After our coffee, we walked up to Kite Hill. The stranger in the photo is not part of the club.
