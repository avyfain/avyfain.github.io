    caption: We finally had a chance to eat at Girl & the Goat, and by mere luck, we got to sit at the chefs' table. It was a great experience to see all the stuff that happens behind the scenes. We even got a dish on the house because the chef right in front of us said we messed up by not ordering his favorite - the lamb ribs - and it ended up being our favorite, too.

There are always good reasons to keep going back to Chicago. This time, it was for Hannah's cousin's wedding.
