    caption: "We arrived late Thursday, and started out Friday morning walking around. Nikhil joined us, and we had coffee at Milstead, which set a high bar for the trip - it ended up being the best coffee we had that weekend."

    caption: We stayed at an Airbnb in Fremont. It was an interesting neighborhood, pretty residential, but also with a bunch of coffee shops and bars.

    caption: Getting a good photo of [The Troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll) is pretty hard, so here's the street opposite to it.

    caption: We were on the fence about going to the Space Needle, but it was fun. It's retrofuturism gave us a sense of what people in the 60s thought the future would be like.

    caption: The Museum of Pop Culture was super cool, but it felt like a hodge podge. By far, the part I enjoyed the most was the Nirvana room, where they mapped out the history of the band and the rise of grunge as a genre in the early 90s. I kept thinking of my brothers and their music taste as I walked around the exhibits. The Hendrix room had the same "Seattle connection" value to it, and the "famous guitars" room was fun to walk around, but the rest of the museum just didn't feel cohesive.

    caption: Starbucks Reserve is an exercise in marketing more than anything else, but we had to go check it out. The steampunk vibe is real.

    caption: On our last day there, we went to the Museum of History and Industry. Here's Megan looking through a periscope there. I would totally have overlooked this museum if my friend Kate hadn't pointed it out. It provides a deep dive of Seattle history, from it's first settlers to it's twentieth century industrialization. Then, it takes a hard turn to the more recent tech boom, with a lot of praise for Microsoft and Amazon (perhaps too much).

Our friends Hannah and Andrew were getting married in Seattle, which gave me a great excuse to go and explore the city. It was my first time there, so we did some touristy things, and we spent a good amount of time hanging out with friends from NU who had also traveled there for the event. I didn't want to be the weirdo with the camera, so there are no photos of the wedding itself.
