    caption: Getting on the shuttle to the car rental place was a disaster. We ended up getting on the wrong one on purpose, because the one for our rental place didn't come for far too long. The walk wasn't too bad.

During one of our many hikes, a few friends were saying they'd love to go down to Southern California for a Disneyland trip. A few weeks later our friend Ben reached out to ask whether we'd go if he organized the trip as a surprise for his girlfiend Maizie's birthday. I wasn't too excited about it, but between him and Hannah I was talked into it, and signed up.

We left on a Friday evening after work, and spent the weekend enjoying the parks. I was skeptical, but it ended up being a ton of fun.
