    caption: There was a little park between the two convention centers, and conference attendees took advantage of the sun almost every afternoon for lunch.

    caption: After the first full conference day, I decided spontaneously to go on a hike. Since the sun would set past 11pm, this meant I had many hours to walk around, so I took a Lyft to Kincaid Park, and proceeded to walk back to the city along the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail.

    caption: I had never heard of [frisbee golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf) but apparently it is popular in Alaska. As I lost myself in the park's trails again and again I kept finding myself in front of these baskets.

    caption: Anchorage is relatively small, so I tried to explore outside of the main downtown strip. I expected that the city would have more of its own character, but there wasn't much to see, and honestly it felt very much like a mediocre Midwestern suburb. In fact, I kept thinking that its aesthetic must be informed by the fact that it's a city that caters to many [premium mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) tourists.

    caption: Clearly, people in Anchorage care about landscaping during the summer. The whole downtown area was covered in flowers, and I saw people taking care of them daily. Most houses I walked past had nice gardens outside, too. I guess that's what happens when you live half the year cold and covered in snow - Chicago wasn't too different.

    caption: After the second day of the conference ended, I went to the Anchorage Museum. The [Seed Lab](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/polar-lab/projects/seed-lab/) had a strong protest art installation right outside. "We are the asteroid" was my favorite of these signs.

    caption: The [Alaska exhibit](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibits/alaska-exhibition/) and the [Living Our Cultures](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/living-our-cultures-sharing-our-heritage-the-first-peoples-of-alaska/) exhibits were fascinating for very different reasons. Both kept me thinking about identity formation, culture preservation, and belonging all day. A lot of the narratives in the museum revolve around the loss of language, the loss of shared traditions, and the tension between the Alaskan identity and the US identity of the people who live and lived there.

    caption: At the exhibit on native cultures, a recurring theme was how each of those tribes would refer to themselves as variations "the people," or "the real people," etc. The fact that Alaskans use ["inside/outside"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outside_(Alaska)) language to refer to the rest of the world as opposed to themselves was striking after reading so much about the colonization and alienation of the local peoples. It was a bit too literal.

    caption: The whole third floor was an [Alaskan art and photography exhibit](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibits/art-of-the-north/). There were a lot of beautiful pieces, and many of them dealt with identity and the self-perception of people in Alaska, such as the [I am Inuit](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibits/i-am-inuit/) photo series or Erica Lord's haunting [Blood Quantum](https://ericalord.com/artwork/302897-Blood-Quantum-1-4-1-16-5-16.html). Others were much lighter, like the room devoted to the role salmon plays in Alaska's daily life, or this one where there was nothing but a few benches.

    caption: I tried coffee at four or five different shops. My favorite ended up being [Steamdot](https://www.steamdot.com/), but my experience at Side Street Espresso was very memorable. The place is run by an old couple, and the sheer number of kitsch artifacts crammed together in the oddly laid out space made their store feel very homey, real, in a way that no hipster coffee shop in SF has ever made me feel.

    caption: In my walks around the city I ended up in neighborhoods that felt in disarray. Homelessness and poverty are very much in your face.

    caption: I missed my chance of taking a good shot, as I was talking to Hannah when I noticed this guy started running. This looked like a lot of fun, though.

    preview_url: alaska/previews/62.jpg
    caption: Denali is big (larger than Massachussetts!), so once you drive to the park's only entrance you have to take these buses to go further in. Going to the main attractions near Wonder Lake takes another 4 hours (each way!) on the bus, so we decided against it. On a future trip, we'll surely do it and try to camp in the deeper wilderness.

    caption: As we were walking back to the car, Hannah was upset that while we'd seen a bunch of wildlife (beavers! a lynx! a porcupine!) she was jealous of all the moose I had seen at Kincaid Park earlier in the week. As we were driving out, we saw this guy's shadow in the distance as he decided to cross the street. It was the perfect way to close out the trip.

This was all around an amazing and ridiculous trip, half work, and half fun. When my manager suggested that I go to [KDD](https://www.kdd.org/) a few months ago, I had no idea what that meant. I had never heard of the conference, but the fact that it was in Alaska was a big selling point, so even though I wasn't fully aware of what I had signed up for beyond "it's about data mining and analytics", I said yes. Of course, if I was going, I knew I'd have to take advantage of the nature, so I decided to stay the weekend after, and Hannah tagged along.

If you're interested in the more technical stuff, you can check out [this other blog post](/articles/2019/09/05/kdd). Below, there's mostly nature:
