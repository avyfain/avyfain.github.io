    caption: We arrived in Napoli and got dropped off in front of the big gate of an old building on a side street. Once inside, past the gate and the front building, we had to walk through a parking area and a garden to reach our Airbnb, which was next to this courtyard which overlooked the coast.

    caption: We didn't have much time in Napoli, and unfortunately we had a lot of rain. That didn't stop us from walking around.

    caption: "My friend Raffaelle, who grew up in Napoli, gave us a long list of recommendations. Given that we barely had 36 hours in the city, I feel pretty good about how much we got to see.\n

    Galleria Umberto was a life saver during the rain. The place was full of contrasts - nice stores and cafes, but also leaky roofs and street vendors selling knockoff leather goods."

    caption: After the rain passed, we walked over to Santa Chiara. The list of recs included many churches, and for Santa Chiara we were told not to miss out on the Chiostro.

    caption: The streets in Napoli were somewhat thematic. Some had multiple coffee shops in a row. Others were just musical instrument stores, one after the other.

In retrospect, I should have taken a lot more film photos during our trip to Italy. I still don't fully trust myself with film, but there's something that makes these feel very special.

Below are a few more pics from our time in Positano, and then the end of the trip in Napoli.
