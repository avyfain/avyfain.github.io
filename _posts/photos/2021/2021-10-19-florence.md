description: When planning our trip, I was somewhat disappointed that we'd only spend a day in Florence. Knowing it's a place that I'll end up going back to on my own, I didn't try too hard to convince my friends to change our plans - realistically the villa thing won't happen again, but the museums will be waiting for me in a few years.

    caption: There's something odd about wandering through a museum and walking past a piece without giving it a second thought. Each one of these busts is just one more unnamed statue in the collection, but someone put sweat and tears into shaping them so I could walk past the shelf on my way to see David. Curation and narratives rule everything around us.

    caption: As we walked aimlessly through the city, we ran into the set for HBO's [My Brilliant Friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brilliant_Friend_(TV_series)). If you haven't seen it yet, the show is quite good.

When planning our trip, I was somewhat disappointed that we'd only spend a day in Florence. Knowing it's a place that I'll end up going back to on my own, I didn't try too hard to convince my friends to change our plans - realistically the villa thing won't happen again, but the museums will be waiting for me in a few years.

Next time, I'll spend a bit more than 12 hours there.
