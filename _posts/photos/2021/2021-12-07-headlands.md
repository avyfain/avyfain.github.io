    caption: It hadn't been raining recently, so I was very confused about the source of this stream. There was a lot of running water.

    caption: Hannah insisted that we go to Point Bonita to see the sunset instead of heading there the next morning. It was totally worth it.

    caption: Back at the campsite, we found some friends. There was also a racoon who kept getting uncomfortably close to us, but I didn't take any photos of him. We named him Charles.

    caption: The main perk of Bicentennial Campground is this view. Unfortunately, thick fog rolled in not too long after this, and the downside of being right next to the lighthouse is that when there's fog, the foghorns turn on. We slept like shit.

After far too long since our last camping trip, Hannah and I decided to spontaneously book one for the upcoming weekend. There happened to be an opening at Bicentennial Campground in Marin, a tiny 3-site campsite near Point Bonita.
