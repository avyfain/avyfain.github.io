    caption: "Annie and Michael live a few hours away, in Baltimore, and for some reason travel to Philly often enough to know all the spots worth going to. Here we were walking through the garden of the Benjamin Franklin Museum.\n

      I found the steel frames representing long-ago demolished buildings to be an interesting way to display history in what otherwise would be an empty courtyard. Similar \"ghost\" frames are sprinkled throughout downtown."

    caption: "Reading Terminal felt a little bit less touristy than Chelsea Market [in NYC](/photos/2016/10/26/nyc/) or the Ferry Building [in SF](/photos/2016/05/01/sausalito/). I had never really thought about this, but every big city has one of these - Quincy Market [in Boston](/photos/2018/09/08/boston2018/) and Pike Place Market [in Seattle](/photos/2019/11/20/seattle/) come to mind."

After briefly seeing our friends Annie and Michael in [Louisville](/photos/2021/12/05/ky-dc/) for their wedding party, we planned to meet them for a bit longer in Philadelphia. We had planned an East Coast trip to see my family in NYC for Thanksgiving, so adding one more city to the itinerary was pretty easy.
