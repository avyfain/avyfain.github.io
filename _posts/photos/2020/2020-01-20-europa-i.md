description: Thanks to a few really good planners (not me) and a lot of excited online research, this New Years our friend group managed to pull off one of the coolest vacations I've ever been on. We went to Europe for a bit over two weeks. We started off in Prague, went to Vienna for New Years eve, headed to the Alps, and ended up in Z√ºrich. The big cities were waiting for us with a ton of cultural activities, historical spots to explore, and an unhealthy amount of great food and drinks, while the little towns in the Alps ended up being delightfully surprising.

    caption: Our hostel was right next to the downtown area. What we didn't know was that it also happened to be the red light district.

    caption: To start things off, Zach Smith took the few us who got there first to [U Flek≈Ø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Flek%C5%AF), one of the oldest breweries in Prague at 500+ years old. This was the second of many accordion players we saw there.

    caption: They only had one kind of beer at the bar, which meant that waiters would walk around with trays full of mugs of beer and [Becherovka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becherovka), the local spirit, asking if you wanted a new one and simply taking tabs on a little piece of paper that stayed at the table. I thought by the end of dinner things would look like this, but we didn't have that much.

    caption: Seeing the [astronomical clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_astronomical_clock) in Old Prague's Main Square is one of the few memories I have of the time I went to the Czech Republic with my parents in 2001. I remember it being touristy then, but the crowds were pretty insane.

    caption: "Luckily for all of us, Zach Hyman had studied abroad in Prague, and knew how to get us away from the super touristy areas. He insisted that we go to The Pub for its competitive drinking. While we initially shied away from it, it caught on really quickly. It's a really simple concept: you have a tap at your table, and you can serve yourself as much as you want. What's poured from each table is tracked and shown on a monitor, and you compete not just across the room with the other tables, but also the N other locations across the rest of Prague, Czechia, and Europe. Genius."

    caption: The next day, it was easier for some to wake up than others, but we went on an amazing walking tour. Our guide was way overqualified, holding masters degrees in Slavic history/international relations, and doing this between jobs. He was from the US, had married a Czech woman, and was about to start off as the director of some foundation. I asked him for some history book recommendations. Now I have a bunch of Tim Snyder and Simon Winder books on my to-read list.

    caption: I really loved the signage of the underground transit in Prague. It blew my mind that Prague has contactless payments for public transit, while places like San Francisco or New York don‚Äôt. Buying a BART ticket is a mess even if you know what you‚Äôre doing. I literally bought my metro pass here with Apple Pay in seconds.

    caption: The bartender literally invited Maizie to go behind the bar to pick songs to play off of YouTube. It quickly became a Latin dance club. This was indirectly my fault.

    caption: While the rest of the partiers slept away the hangovers, I woke up early and went to meet Danny and Ali for breakfast and to walk in other neighborhoods. We found it oddly quiet, with businesses closed and very few people walking in the streets. It made us wonder whether non-touristy Prague is super empty all year, or if it was just the holidays' effect.

    caption: As I took this photo, Ali asked how I decide _when_ to take a photo, or _what_ is a scene worth photographing. I had no idea how to answer. I said something along the lines of ‚ÄúThe light. It is pretty.‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt really be more specific than that.

    caption: A day of aimless walking took us to [Mozzarellart](http://mozzarellart.com/). Marco, the shopkeeper, gave us a lot of tasty samples, and good advice about things to do in Prague. We talked with him for a while, and got to hear about how he ended up there. He said business is much better in Czechia compared to Italy, so he moved here 6 years ago from Puglia. I regret not asking if I could take his portrait.

    caption: After going back to the hostel, sharing our fresh mozzarella and cold cuts with our hungover friends, and all grabbing lunch together, Danny and I walked along the river to the Kafka museum. Everyone else tried to go to the Jewish Museum, but got there as it was closing. Instead, they settled for the Sex Machines Museum.

    caption: The Kafka Museum was very biographical, and got me thinking about my own identity. They did a good job stretching the little material they had - mostly quotes from his letters, a few of his published works, and some photographs - to paint a complex picture of the author. I didn't know that he was so conflicted about his Jewish identity, nor that he embraced it so much towards the end of his life. They also talked a lot about his works, and while now I have bumped his novels a few spots in my list, I am happy that Danny convinced me to read a few of his short stories ahead of our trip. I really enjoyed [In the Penal Colony](http://johnstoi.web.viu.ca//kafka/inthepenalcolony.htm) and its questioning of moral relativism.

This is the second in a long series I'll be posting in the next few days, so make sure to come back for the next set!

After a [pit stop in the Midwest](/photos/2020/01/20/chindy/) the real thing began in Prague...
