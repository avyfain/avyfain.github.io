    caption: A lot of our neighbors have been making use of their roofs. I have always thought it's odd that San Francisco doesn't have a bigger roof culture.

    caption: I am pretty sure these two don't have jobs. Every few days we can see them from our window, soaking in the sun in the afternoons regardless of the temperature. It felt creepy to point a zoom lens at them.

    caption: Car traffic is way down, but it's still odd to see people walk in the middle of the street for blocks at a time. I think more streets should be closed to car traffic, but that's not a corona related thought.

    caption: These pieces by [Juan Carlos Rodriguez Rivera](https://thejohncharles.com/this-is-weird-without-you) started popping up all over the Mission soon after the shelter in place order started. Their simplicity puts a bittersweet smile on my face whenever I see them. As the first piece in the collection points out, the city feels weird without its bustling bars and coffee shops and restaurants, and more importantly without its people.

    caption: Like most people, I have been facetiming and zooming with friends and family a lot more than usual. It is unfortunate that it takes a destabilizing global pandemic to remind us to make time for people who are close to us.

    caption: A couple of weekends ago, Hannah talked me into going downtown to be freaked out by how empty it'd be. There were only a few people walking around Union Square.

    caption: A downside of having a nice rooftop on a big building is that we're not the only neighbors spending time up there in order to avoid insanity. The upside is that we're getting to know each other a bit better, and people have been generally very nice and careful with the distancing. Kostas is one of the few who I used to run into up there before the craziness started.

Everything is weird. In these strange times, I hope you're holding up, staying healthy, coping, taking care of your loved ones, and trashing every single email that opens with any of the phrases above.

I have been mostly locked up in my apartment, occassionally going up on our rooftop, and taking my camera out almost every time I leave the building. At the top of my list of dumb purchases was a 2x extender for my camera, which effectively turns my zoom lens into a 140-400mm f8.0. It's pretty ridiculous.
