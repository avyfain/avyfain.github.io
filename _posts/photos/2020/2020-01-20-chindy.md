    caption: Hannah wanted to go shopping for shoes, and I was very excited to try out my new 70-200 f/4 lens. Needless to say, I didn't go shopping. The light this morning was great.

    caption: I like it when people notice I'm taking a photo of them across the street, and don't shy away. This lens is not at all inconspicous.

    caption: Then, there was Indianapolis. Sarah and Gabbi took us to the Inferno Room, a Tiki bar. They told a bunch of high school stories that I couldn't relate to at all. It's strange how our daily experiences growing up can be so different and yet so similar.

    caption: Next morning was cousin lunch in Broad Ripple. Josh and Paul were wearing the same shirt. I'm confident it was on purpose. Of course, Matthew was [wearing shorts](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/01/why-some-kids-wear-shorts-all-winter/604633/).

Last year the holidays started off as usual, with a trip back to Chicago and Indianapolis to see Hannah's family, and a few friends. What could have been a whole trip on its own merit ended up feeling like a tiny detour as we went on to many places in Europe.

I took over 3000 photos over the ~three weeks we were traveling, so expect a few more posts in the next couple of weeks.

_This is the first in a long series I'll be posting in the next few days. Make sure to check out parts [one](/photos/2020/01/20/europa-i/) and [two](/photos/2020/01/23/europa-ii/), which have already been published._
