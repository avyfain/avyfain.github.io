    caption: We didn't even think about the fact that it was Memorial Day and that there'd be stuff going on at the San Francisco National Cemetery near the bridge. There were a lot of flags, but very few people.

For Memorial Day weekend, we went on a hike that made it up for months of being locked down in our apartment. Hannah and I walked all the way from our apartment in the Mission to Kirby Cove and back, picking up our friend Nikhil a few miles in, near the Haight. Without thinking too much about it, we ended up doing a 21 mile day.

My feet hated me for it.
