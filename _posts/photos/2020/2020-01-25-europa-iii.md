description: Next up were the Austrian Alps. Initially, I wasn't too excited about this part of the trip, since I wasn't planning to partake in the snow sports, and it felt like we'd end holed up in our cabin without exploring too much. It ended up being one of the best parts of the trip.

    caption: Technically, I'm cheating, because this is still Vienna. We had to take a train to Salzburg, where we'd rented a car to drive up the mountains.

    caption: This was the nicest accomodation we had during our trip. The kitchen was awesome, and I really enjoyed cooking for the group a couple of the nights. This evening, however, I was not in charge.

    caption: Ben and Maizie's German friends Fedo and Hannah joined us for this leg of the trip. It was really fun to have another two people in the mix, and I really enjoyed the fact that they brought the European perspective to our conversations. I was warned that I should not engage in political conversations with Fedo, but the few we did have were quite insightful.

    caption: The classic Hallstadt photo. [Apparently](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/world/europe/hallstatt-austria-frozen-tourists.html), so many people are coming to the city to take this same photo that they are closing it down to tourist buses!
