    caption: We met really early at Candlestick Point, the Southeasternmost point in the city. For some reason, Ben decided to wear corduroys.

    caption: The first chunk of the hike was pretty barren, and I'd probably start out in Visitacion Valley if I do it again. It definitely feels like the trail starts where it does to check off a box. We literally had to walk through an office park.

Back in November, when we could still go outside and interact with other people, a new trail opened in San Francisco: [The Crosstown Trail](https://crosstowntrail.org/map/), a 17 mile hike in the middle of the city hitting a bunch of neighborhoods and local businesses, climbing to many lookout points, and cutting through multiple parks, large and small. It wasn't hard to convince our friends to hike it.
