    caption: Deciding what would be dinner took the group a long time, and people couldn't agree. I walked away, bought myself some bread, meats, and cheese, and knew that I couldn't go wrong.

    caption: We were all excited about Viennese Café culture, and trying out a few places. It’s odd that these coffeehouses, initially known for being intellectual hubs where ideas flowed and people would meet up for interesting conversations have just turned into tourist attractions. In some sense, it’s the intellectual/social version of [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law).

    caption: We waited for a long time, and the waiters were super rude. When we said we had 6 people, they said they wouldn't seat us. Hannah and I sat together, and the rest of the group sat on a second table. Overall, I'd say it was worth it just for the apple strudel.

    caption: As expected, we visited a few bookstores. It was interesting to see what’s translated into German from English/Spanish, as well as what is sold for the English speakers. Also, curiously, every shop had a ton of music CDs. I don’t remember the last time I saw that in the US.

    caption: Walking around the palaces and promenades in Vienna I couldn't stop thinking of my mom, who, for some reason, as a child was obsessed with the idea of Austrian royalty. The opulence and detail of the architecture was stunning.

    caption: According to our tour guide, the Habsburgs were obsessed with death, and had some crazy rituals around it, such as burying the heart separately from the rest of the body. This sculpture represents one such heart burial.

    caption: Hannah and I ended up walking to the Leopold museum and having breakfast there. It was one of my favorite places from the whole trip. The whole exhibit was excellent, and while the main focus is Klimt, I really enjoyed the graphic design work of [Koloman Moser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koloman_Moser), particularly his posters and stamps. I would have loved to see the section on German art, which represented a reaction to the post-war period, but unfortunately we didn't have enough time.
