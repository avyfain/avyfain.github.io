    caption: We parked by the beach to walk on the Venice Beach Boardwalk. It was a weekday, and the parking lot was totally empty, except for the birds.

    caption: Hollywood is weird. We did an audio tour, and got to learn a lot about the history of how it came about, and the first theatres there. Apparently you just have to pay a lot of money to get your own star on the Walk of Fame.

A couple of weeks ago we went to LA. The original plan was to go to the Grand Canyon, but it was going to be way too cold there for me to agree.

We had a lot of fun, and ate great food but, overall, I'd say I didn't like the city. It is way too spread out, and we spent roughly the same amount of time in traffic as out of it. After the fact, someone who was born and raised there told me that we should have just done one or two adjecent neighborhoods, instead of trying to hit Hollywood, Venice, Santa Monica and a couple of others all in a weekend. For me, that's a deal breaker, but we'll probably go back anyway. I still want to see the Getty, the Broad, and spend some time in Downtown LA, which we didn't have the time to do this trip. Maybe we'll pair that with a road trip down Highway 1, which is still on the to-do list.
