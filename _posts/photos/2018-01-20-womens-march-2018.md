It's odd that large scale protests like the Woman's March have become so mainstream. Sadly, I think they are more useful as cathartic exercises than as sources of political change, but I still think it is important to take part. When Hannah asked me if I wanted to join her and a few friends, I said yes right away.

Last year I was [stuck at home without a visa](http://www.faingezicht.com/articles/2017/01/30/not-today), and could not attend. I'm happy I was there today, showing that I care.
