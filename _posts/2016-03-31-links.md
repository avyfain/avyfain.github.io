I have spent a lot of time lately trying to understand, and playing around with, computer vision, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other machine learning models. Between Stanford's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/) course, [Trask's neural stack explanation](https://iamtrask.github.io/2016/02/25/deepminds-neural-stack-machine/), playing [snake with Keras](https://github.com/bitwise-ben/Snake) and creating [image analogies](https://github.com/awentzonline/image-analogies), I have spent a lot more time than usual coding and training machine learning models after work. More accurately, I have spent hours poring over complex equations I don't yet fully understand, and waiting for models to converge.

Even if you are not a computer scientist, you should read the intro to reinforcement learning linked below. With some understanding of economic modeling, and a bit of effort, you'll get the basics of how a system like AlphaGo works. Machine, or otherwise, learning is fun.
