  - title: The trouble with books

    source: Unenumerated

    note: "Here, Szabo argues that conditions around book publishing and distribution makes for little variety, and unnecessarily long documents. He calls it the \"trouble with books\", and poses the internet as the solution. The \"trouble with the internet\" is noise. Publishers and editors used to be trusted gatekeepers, ensuring a certain level of quality. There is too much content to consume from the Internet firehose. How do we deal with content quality assurance and curation in the internet era? How do we pick what we read?"
