  - title: "The Science of Happiness: Why complaining is literally killing you"
    author: Steven Parton
    source: Science and Nonduality
    url: http://scienceandnonduality.com/?p=93935
    note: '"Your thoughts reshape your brain, and thus are changing a physical construct of reality." After all, it is *all* in your head.'
  - title: We Should All Have Something To Hide
    author: Moxie Marlinspike
    url: http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/we-should-all-have-something-to-hide/
    note: An oldie, but a goodie. Very fitting these days with the whole ï£¿ vs FBI story. Moxie makes good arguments against 100% effective law enforecement.
  - title: How to Deploy Software
    author: Zach Holman
    url: https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software
    note: "Making good decisions upfront, and investing in improving the software development process (via testing, CI/CD, etc.) is costly, but pays off over time. This is especially important as the organization grows. Building software is easier when you're not afraid of breaking it."
  - title: "Seeing Economic Patterns That Don't Exist"
    author: Noah Smith
    source: Bloomberg View
    url: http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-03-02/we-get-fooled-by-economic-patterns-that-don-t-exist
  - title: We Hire the Best, Just Like Everyone Else
    author: Jeff Atwood
    source: Coding Horror
    url: http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-hire-the-best-just-like-everyone-else/
    note: I have been involved in several interviews since I started working full time 8 months ago. The process is unbelievably broken. Jeff makes good points on *how* and *why* that is so.
  - title: The architect of the Reich
    author: Michael J. Lewis
    source: New Criterion

Today I am posting from Indianapolis! I am spending the weekend here with Hannah's family, and I got a lot of reading done on the flight here, so the article selection today is better than usual.
