Today I discovered an amazing LinkedIn feature that I did not know existed. It is called "Connections In The News". 

With the subject "News about Aaron Dallek" sitting in my inbox, LinkedIn's email really intrigued me. Clicking through took me to a [New York Times article about Opternative](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/take-an-eye-exam-on-your-laptop/), the startup where I used to work, and where Aaron is CEO.  Quite simply, LinkedIn parsed Aaron's name from the piece, and notified me that one of my contacts was mentioned in it. How the software distinguishes between various people named [John Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith), or whether it tries at all, is unclear to me, but the feature provided me with a pleasant surprise.
