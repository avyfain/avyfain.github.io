Several comments today: 

First, if you are reading the AVC posts, make sure to read them together. I think the analogy is flawed, but the underlying idea of "collecting the economic surplus of a revolution" is spot on.

Second, I'd like to thank my friend Yoav for pointing out Sapiens. I had skipped the [EconTalk episode](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/10/yuval_harari_on.html) until he called it the best book he's ever read. I trust his recommendations, even though he doesn't trust mine.

Lastly, Politico's website is kind of annoying, but their [article about transportation-oriented development in Evanston](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/evanston-illinois-what-works-213282) was super interesting. 

Having lived there for a good chunk of my life, I can tell first hand that Evanston doesn't feel like a suburb. In fact, when discussing this article, I said "Evanston is actually part of the city, it is basically Chicago" and the response I got was "the fact that you think so means that the policy was successful." 

Guess so.
