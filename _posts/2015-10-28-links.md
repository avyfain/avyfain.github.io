Politico's website is kind of annoying, but their [article about transportation-oriented development in Evanston](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/evanston-illinois-what-works-213282) was super interesting. 

Having lived there for a good chunk of my life, I can tell first hand that Evanston doesn't feel like a suburb. In fact, when discussing this article, I said "Evanston is actually part of the city, it is basically Chicago" and the response I got was "the fact that you think so means that the policy was successful". 

Guess so.
