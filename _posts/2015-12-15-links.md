I have not actually read Feinstein's whole paper, but the abstract makes it seem like an amazing read:
> In this paper we study the financial repercussions of the destruction of two fully armed and
operational moon-sized battle stations (“Death Stars”) in a 4-year period and the dissolution of
the galactic government in Star Wars. The emphasis of this work is to calibrate and simulate
a model of the banking and financial systems within the galaxy. Along these lines, we measure
the level of systemic risk that may have been generated by the death of Emperor Palpatine and
the destruction of the second Death Star. We conclude by finding the economic resources the
Rebel Alliance would need to have in reserve in order to prevent a financial crisis from gripping
the galaxy through an optimally allocated banking bailout.

Mind. Blown.
