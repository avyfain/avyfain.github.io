> “It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much.” ― Seneca, On the Shortness of Life

As I said in my last post: attention is a zero sum game. I checked how much I have been reading online lately and I'm way below average (Yes, I keep stats on this. Yes, I know its nerdy). According to data from the past 2.5 years, I read about 10 articles per day (avg. 10.02, median 9) but in the last three weeks I've been floating between 5-7 per day. I think it will be impossible to keep up the usual 10-12 while maintaining my book reading goal and my new (bad?) habit of scrolling through Twitter a couple of times a day.

However, I'm proud to say that in the past couple of weeks I finished [Why Information Grows](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Information-Grows-Evolution-Economies/dp/0465048994) and moved on to [Cool Gray City of Love](http://www.amazon.com/Cool-Gray-City-Love-Francisco/dp/1608199606). Some thoughts on those two are coming.
