Today, out of curiosity I went back to [the first post](http://avc.com/2003/09/my_first_post/) in the archive of Fred Wilson's AVC. I was surprised by the terseness, and the simplicity.

Maybe that's all I need to start writing more. Lowering the bar I set for myself. If Fred could do it, way back in September 2003, why shouldn't I?

> I read blogs a lot. And i think they are great. So i am starting a blog. I have no idea if i’ll write a lot in my blog or rarely. I hope its a lot, because i have a lot to say. But we’ll see about that.

Seems like he did have a lot to say. Wilson is one of my favorite bloggers. I read him daily, making his closing statement particularly entertaining in hindsight.

Another inspiring case is Benedict Evans, who five years ago was getting only [~200 monthly page views](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/14/distribution-and-audience) and now gets hundreds of thousands of hits per month. However, his strategy was very different: his first posts are in-depth analytical essays, just like the ones he posts in 2015.

I'll aim in between, and settle if I can get even a tenth of their audience.
