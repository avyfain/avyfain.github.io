description: A couple of weeks ago, after seeing the first version of John Burn-Murdoch and co.'s [Coronavirus data visualizations](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest) on the Financial Times, I decided that someone had to run the equivalent analysis aggregating at the state level for the US. Some searching led me to [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), a project by two journalists at The Atlantic, [Robinson Meyer](https://twitter.com/yayitsrob/) and [Alexis Madrigal](https://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/), which broke out the data exactly as I'd needed, and offered an easy to use API.

A couple of weeks ago, after seeing the first version of John Burn-Murdoch and co.'s [Coronavirus data visualizations](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest) on the Financial Times, I decided that someone had to run the equivalent analysis aggregating at the state level for the US. Some searching led me to [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/), a project by two journalists at The Atlantic, [Robinson Meyer](https://twitter.com/yayitsrob/) and [Alexis Madrigal](https://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/), which broke out the data exactly as I'd needed, and offered an easy to use API. After noodling around in a Jupyter notebook for a bit, I came up with this:

My tweets about the analysis were picked up by [Hamel Husain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain) who kindly offered to host my notebook in his auto-updating collection of [COVID-19 Dashboards](https://covid19dashboards.com). Thanks to the magic of open source software, and a few bugs later, my analysis evolved into the image at the very top of this blog post, and unfortunately I ended up adding another chart to track deaths:

![COVID19 deaths growth chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/covid19-dashboard/master/images/covid-death-rate-states.png "COVID19 deaths growth chart")

If time allows, in the next few days I'll update the chart to include a [small multiple chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple) inspired by some of the [work that's being done by Ben F. Maier and Dirk Brockmann](rocs.hu-berlin.de/corona/).
