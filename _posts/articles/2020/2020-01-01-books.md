<br>In one of the strangest years of my life so far, I didn't stop reading. While there were a couple of stints where I didn't have the time or motivation to read for weeks at a time, I still made my goal: reading the equivalent of 24 books of 300 pages each, or ~7200 pages total. Some were much longer, and others shorter, but things averaged out, which was the whole point of not setting a goal based on number of books, but pages.

For 2019, there was a healthy mix of fiction and non-fiction, and a good portion of the books were assignments for [The Modern and the Postmodern](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-postmodern-1/), Michael Roth's MOOC. I also read a lot of selected chapters and short essays from a variety of sources, but I'm not including them in this list. For those, check out my [links of the year recap](/).

Anyway, on to the books!

{% for book in page.books %}
  <div class="book-review" id="{{book.title | downcase | replace: ' ', '-'}}">
  <h4>{{ book.title }} - {{ book.author }}</h4>
  <img class="book-cover book-border" src="{{ site.image_path }}books/{{ book.image }}">
  <p>{{ book.description | markdownify }}</p>
  </div>
{% endfor %}

For 2020, I'll stick with my page count goal, increasing the estimate to 30 books, which should take me to ~9000. It's ambitious, but it's the only way I will be make it through [this ridiculous spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkbAVV86-HRxxl0PlCTVl_beF2GjvofUYeVyuNAAQTg/edit#gid=0). If you think there's a bookÂ I should add to my queue, or just want to share a thought on my reviews above, [please reach out](/contact)!

You can find my reviews for previous years here: [2018](/articles/2019/02/14/books/), [2017](/articles/2018/01/07/books/), and [2016](/articles/2017/01/06/books/).
