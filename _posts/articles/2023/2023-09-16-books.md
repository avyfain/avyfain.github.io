    - title: The Year of Magical Thinking
      author: Joan Didion
      image: joan-didion-year-of-magical-thinking.jpeg
      description: "This is a deeply personal book about grief. _The Year of Magical Thinking_ speaks to the raw emotions that follow Didion after the loss of her husband. As I read, I couldn't help but trace the parallels between Didion's telling of her husband John's death and my mom's experience (and, obviously, the whole family) coming to terms with my dad's passing. The suddenness, the recounting of the scene, the constant what-if's, and the sheer disorientation of becoming untethered from a life partner, all seemed too familiar.\n

      She quotes C.S. Lewis, on the haunting notion of having to navigate the world without a partner who's no longer there:\n

      > So many roads lead thought to H. I set out on one of them. But now there's an impassable frontierpost across it. So many roads once; now so many cul de sacs.\n

      Though Didion passed away at the end of 2021, her book was at the top of my list before then. _The Year of Magical Thinking_ did not comfort me, nor did it bring me catharsis, but reading it somewhat clarified my thoughts on the complex and confusing experience of grief by letting me see it through someone else's eyes. This is a tough book."
    - title: The Bonfire of the Vanities
      author: Tom Wolfe
      image: tom-wolfe-bonfire-of-the-vanities.jpeg
      description: "This is one of those books I'd heard mentioned many times, but I had no idea what I was getting into as I started reading it. _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ is a novel set in the 80s that discusses the structure of society, with criss-crossing cuts of race, class, religion, occupations and more.\n

      The plot centers around Sherman McCoy, a New York financier, and his fall from grace after a hit-and-run. Much of _The Bonfire of the Vanities_ focuses on the distinction between reality and appearances, and how facts and intentions don't really matter when our actions are perceived as transgressions of a social contract. This is explicit in the journalistic treatment of McCoy and the judicial case that follows his accident, but also hinted at repeatedly throughout the story. For example in discussing the field of finance and its relationship with \"the real world,\" McCoy repeatedly struggles to explain how he brings value to the world as a bond trader. The value he creates is detached from the tangible, manifesting instead in the abstract movements dictated by the whims of the market. That is just another flavor of the same idea: others' perception affects our reality, and the value we ascribe to   things.\n

      The scene when McCoy reflects on his identity after being ostracized by friends and neighbors carries the central message of the book. After being arrested, McCoy realizes his life is only defined by others around him: \"Your self... is other people, all the people you’re tied to, and it’s only a thread.\" Our identity, our self-worth, [and our meaning](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/) are defined by others. I might do a longer blog post on this idea down the line."
    - title: How To Change
      author: Katy Milkman
      image: katy-milkman-how-to-change.jpeg
      description: "I picked up _How To Change_ after hearing Milkman on [Russ Roberts' podcast, Econtalk](https://www.econtalk.org/katy-milkman-on-how-to-change/). Roberts tends to be really skeptical of pop psychology, so I gave his positive review a heavier weight than usual. The book contains the self-help advice that you'd expect, but backed by repeated studies and theory. Milkman repackages these idea into \"choice architecture,\" a systematic approach to how we present options to ourselves. She argues that much like economists and politicians think about governance and policy one level of abstraction up, so should we: not focusing on individual decisions, but the incentives we set up to make it easier to choose behaviors that are aligned with our goals.\n

      Among many other examples, Milkman discusses strategies like \"accountability partners\" and public commitments as ways to change our habits. She showcases replicated experiments on simple ideas like writing down our goals, or telling our friends what we're aiming at. She also explains how she coined the term \"temptation bundling\" to describe a behavior we're all familiar with: pairing a desirable activity (like watching TV or listening to podcasts) with a less desirable one (like exercising) in order to incentivize the latter. These approaches toward self-control are not particularly innovative, but it is useful to see them all back to back in one tome. Milkman does not pretend that these are one-size fits all, but instead suggests that we should mix and match the tools she presents to achieve real, permanent change."

    - title: The Plague
      author: Albert Camus
      translator: Stuart Gilbert
      image: albert-camus-the-plague.jpeg
      description: "A classic existentialist novel, _The Plague_ narrates the story of a small town suddenly affected by an epidemic that decimates it's people. In a volume that feels all too familiar in 2023, Camus' characters' lives intersect with the outbreak in all sorts of uncomfortable ways. There's those whose life projects are stopped in their tracks, those who try to help others combat the plague directly, some that only care about saving themselves at the expense of their neighbors.\n

        Camus prompts us to reflect on our meaninglessness by critiquing the institutions of government, church, and even journalism. He does not outright condemn these, but rather presents them as tools which humans use to grapple with the challenges of existence. He highlights the complexities of faith and the limitations of institutions when confronted with the harsh realities of suffering and death. _The Plague_ invites readers to reflect on the nature of faith, moral responsibility, and the potential for false hopes in the midst of existential crises.\n

        Ultimately, the point Camus tries to get across is that life is a succession of minor plagues that we must face. There is no new normal, just normal."
    - title: Inside Out
      author: Nick Mason
      image: nick-mason-inside-out.jpeg
      description: "This was the first of many rock musicians' biographies that I've read recently. Mason is one of the lesser-known founding members of Pink Floyd, and _Inside Out_ is his telling of the band's rise to fame. The original members, including Mason on the drums, met while they were architecture students in London. A good chunk of the book is devoted to their personal conflicts: lead guitarist Syd Barrett's deteriorating mental health, his successive replacement with David Gilmour, and the eventual tensions that broke the original crew.\n

      A recurring theme in the book is that while they were gaining traction, the bandmembers were not particularly aware of their significance within the broader music scene. Mason goes into detail explaining how the band's style evolved, from the early days exploring recording experimental pieces and focusing on moods to the flashy performances of their world tours. He also tells of the eccentricities him and others indulged in as the money started pouring in. Cars, island homes, and private studios went hand in hand with interpersonal conflict, and Mason isn't shy about sharing either side.\n

      The book doesn't feel ghostwritten, and is full of fortuitous anecdotes of what the band experienced on their way to the top. Some of those contingent moments really stayed with me, from the spontaneity with which they chose the name _Pink Floyd_, the time that their van was broken into and Mason's mom was able to lend them £200 to replace their equipment, or the time at Abbey Road Studios when the band realized they were recording next door to The Beatles, and their producer Norman Smith was able to get Mason and company a chance to see them record. The book honors its title, sharing many of the inside stories of a great band."
    - title: The Sovereign Individual
      author: James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg
      image: davidson-rees-mogg-sovereign-individual.jpeg
      description: "I believe I first heard of _The Sovereign Individual_ in a tweet or HN thread that described it as having \"a startup idea on every page.\" While it didn't live up to my expectations in that sense, the future they speculate is a profoundly interesting unbundling of modern society, and it makes a great read. The core thesis proposed by Davidson and Rees-Mogg is that as technology advances, individuals will be able to exercise greater control over their finances, and thus their lives. In short, they predict that the internet and encryption will reduce state visibility into people's wealth and income, to the point of the decline of traditional nation-states (see what I said about biases?). _The Sovereign Individual_ emphasizes privacy-preserving peer-to-peer technologies as tools to resist coercion in this new era, foreshadowing the eventual rise of cryptocurrency in the 2010s. It's hard to believe this book was first published in 1997.

      While there have been significant geopolitical changes since the book came out, the pace and extent of these shifts have not led to the weakening of all nation-states as predicted. I'll grant that many of the ideas resonated with my own biases, but it'd be hard to argue they are not at least plausible. We have not yet seen the erosion of state authority pushed by the authors, but wealth preservation and tax avoidance techniques that were previously only available to the ultra-rich are now within the reach of many.\n

       Yes, this book panders to the crypto crowd. Yes, it stretches reality to fit with its libertarian tendencies a bit too much. However, the vision, and the foresight to write this 25 years ago is commendable.\n

    - title: Los Detectives Salvajes
      author: Roberto Bolaño
      image: roberto-bolaño-detectives-salvajes.jpeg
      description: "_Los Detectives Salvajes_ is a sprawling book about a group of young poets and their adventures in the 1960s and '70s in Mexico. Reading it, I kept wanted to discuss the places and the people with my dad, who was a college student in Mexico City in the early 70s. Bolaño tells a self-discovery story as the group searches for meaning, identity, and live the rebellious spirit of the time. Through a wide cast of characters, the novel explores the transformative power of art, the chaos of life, and constantly blurs the lines between reality and fiction.\n

      The novel centers on Mexico's counterculture through feuding literary movements. It does so by telling individuals' deeply intertwined stories. The characters in the book are stand-ins for the author and his friends, while a few others are just representations of themselves - like Octavio Paz. With its fragmented and non-linear narrative, it reminds the reader of Córtazar's [_Rayuela_](https://faingezicht.com/articles/2020/03/26/rayuela/), but heavily reflects the political and social upheavals of Latin America during the 20th century. including the influence of the Mexican student movement and the dictatorship in Chile (where Bolaño is originally from).

      Los Detectives Salvajes was kind of a slog. I enjoyed its themes, but between its length, its confusing narrative, and the deep cuts of Latin American history and literateure, I doubt most people reading this blog would enjoy it.

Phaedrus was my first ever foray into Greek classics, and I probably would not have jumped in without this kind of guidance.

      description: Spitznagel is one of Nassim Taleb's collaborators, and my friend Mike recommended it to me when we were both still at Vouch. Safe Haven merges a lot of insurance and investing topics, and takes a pretty deep dive into the barbell investment theory that Taleb popularized.

      author: Russ Roberts
      image: russ-roberts-wild-problems.jpeg
      description: I often say that studying economics broke my brain. There are few contemporary thinkers who have shaped my worldview as much as Russ Roberts has. This book is the crystallization of Russ's struggle _un_breaking his own brain, helping others like me undo the damage of homo-economicus thinking while keeping the most valuable lessons of the field. Reading it I kept laughing at how few of the arguments he made seemed novel to me, in part because by then I had listened to hundreds of episodes of his podcast, _Econtalk_, but because I'd internalized many of those ideas into my day to day life even if I had forgotten the source.
      
        _Wild Problems_ is a  rejection of many of the basic tenets of the field of economics he grew up in. Studying at the University of Chicago under ___, Russ is  took the assumptions of rationality and basic information

    - title: Anarchy State Utopia
      author: Robert Nozick
      image: robert-nozick-anarchy-state-utopia.jpeg
      description: I was first introduced to Nozick with his ____ thought experiment, which made me put this book on my list years ago. I knew the book would be much broader, but was really surprised when I realized the thought experiment is a side comment on a side comment that spans just a couple of pages. _Anarchy State Utopia_ is a treatise on libertarianism, trying to argue for it from first principles by hypothesizing the rise of early societies as they evolved out of a Hobbesian state of nature.

      While I agreed broadly with his perception of A and B, not surprisingly, Nozick leans further into libertarianism than me, making assertions such as X and Y.
