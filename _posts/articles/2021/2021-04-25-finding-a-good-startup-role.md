If you're here looking for advice, feel free to skip the first section on _constraints_, but it might be helpful to think about these questions for your own decisions, too. On the other hand, if you're here because you know me and want to learn about the way I worked through this life decision, thanks for being part of my life and for caring enough to read this!

### Narrowing down, getting in
Building a list was the easy part. Researching these companies and their open roles in a somewhat systematic way was harder.

The first step was working my way through their websites to build a spreadsheet with a row per company, and columns for its investors, size, funding, and whether they had roles that could be a good fit. This process probably eliminated two thirds of the companies, as I found that they were not hiring people with my profile, that they were much bigger than I thought, or that their traction wasn't as strong as I'd like. It probably would have been a good idea to come up with some kind of sorting function here, but my prioritization was haphazard, with companies that resonated the most near the top.

The next step was working through my network to see if there was any way to get introduced to the founders. Having been in Silicon Valley for a few years, I had a few second degree connections on LinkedIn that I could leverage. For those where I didn't I just reached out directly to their CEOs and CTOs[^1], asking if there might be an opening for someone with my profile. Short personal messages are generally better than cover letters.

If you are coming in with a warm introduction and there's a relevant opening, you'll likely get a first call. On the other hand, if you're reaching out cold, you'll be lucky if you hear back from more than 10-20% of companies. Either way, while you're at this stage you will feel like your messages are going into a black hole half the time. Make sure to follow up a few days after your initial email if you don't hear back - people are busy, and you're not their top priority, but help yourself by bumping your email to the top of their inbox.

It is a good idea to have multiple processes in parallel, and at different stages, but I'd recommend not juggling processes with more than 5 companies at a time. As you get rejections, reach out to the next companies in your list. Sequencing is important, or you'll end up having to schedule everything at the same time, which is especially hard if you're holding a job.

### Interviewing
I had not done any interviewing in more than four years, since I switched into my new team at Apple, so I was rusty. Starting with a few companies that were not in the top of my list helped me make sure that by the time I got to the ones I actually cared about I would be comfortable discussing my recent projects and explaining what I was looking for. In that respect, I could have done better.

At every stage of the interviewing process, remember that you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you.

#### First calls, informational interviews, screens, and take-homes
Depending on the stage of the startup you're talking to, this might be a call with a recruiter, someone in the leadership group, or the CEO. Regardless of who you're talking to, you have two main goals in this first conversation:

1. **Sell yourself as a great candidate.** Show your excitement, and be prepared to explain why you'd be a good fit for the role. Have a clear answer to why you are interviewing with them, and come in with specific questions about their business and their culture.
2. **Validate that your assumptions about the company are real.** You want to leave that conversation knowing if the product reflects their marketing, whether they have hired/raised more than their online presence shows, etc.

Assuming that you manage (1) and that there are no surprises to (2), you should ask about next steps and a rough timeline. If you did well, you'll likely go to a second interview. If you're looking at technical IC roles it's likely going to be a coding screen, but otherwise this second call won't be too different. If your first call was with a recruiter, or if this is a larger company, there might be a third interview before going to an onsite, too.

Make sure to send a follow up email thanking your interviewers, and share links to any relevant projects or articles you might have mentioned during your calls. Take this as another opportunity to show off your work, and your understanding of the space the startup operates in. Remember that you want the people who interviewed you rooting for you when they are sharing their feedback about you, so give them as many tools as you can.

At this stage, it's also possible that you'll be asked to work on a take home assignment. I didn't have to do one of these for the companies I interviewed at this time, but they're common for both technical and go-to-market roles. Fast turnaround is a good signal here, so do your best to work through these quickly.

During this process, if you catch any red flags, or the opportunity simply doesn't seem that interesting, you should not be afraid of telling them that you think it might not be a great fit. If you're doing this right, not all companies should go through this filter. Don't waste your time nor theirs.

#### Onsite panels
If you make it past the first few calls, you'll be invited to 4-5 hours of conversations with a panel of different team members. Even though these are held via video conference these days, people insist in calling them "onsites." Since you'll be taking these from your desk at home, it's fair to ask them to split them over a few days.

You should ask the person scheduling your panel for the names of the people you'll be talking to, and a list of topics that will be covered by each one. Look these people up on LinkedIn, and see what kind of things they work on, in order to tailor your answers and prepare questions. Most likely, these are people you'd be working with closely, so use the onsite as a way to learn about how the team operates, the challenges, and the exciting parts of working in that team.

### Making a decision
At this point, hopefully you've learned that the panel went well and they're moving on to an offer. You should have a pretty good understanding of the team you might join and the efforts you'd be involved in. If you sequenced your conversations right, you should have more than one offer in flight, which will allow you to negotiate later on.

More on this topic, and how to evaluate offers in an upcoming post.

#### Speaking to leadership
Some companies might ask you to talk to the CEO or a senior leader of the group you will join. If they do, great, otherwise, you should ask for it. This conversation should give you another chance to get clarity on long term vision, and you get to make a strong impression on someone who will have influence on your future if you end up joining the company.

A list of good questions to ask will be part of an upcoming post

#### Backchanneling
If you have any way to learn about the company outside of the interview loop, do it. If you can get connected with people who used to work there, people who work there currently in other areas, or even investors and advisors, their comments could give you a different angle

[^1]: Most people are surprisingly accessible, and first_name@company.com is a good starting point if you can't find their actual address from their online presence. If a company is large enough that the CEO is not involved in recruitment, they'll forward you to the right person if there could be a good fit.
