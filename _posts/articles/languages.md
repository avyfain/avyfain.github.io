In a very specific, and personal, example, I am debating what programming language I should spend my time and effort on learning next, after Python. Roughly, I have four options:
Be pragmatic, and improve my very primitive JavaScript. As a working tool, it is one I'm most likely to apply in any future team I join.
Take advantage of the shiny new wave pushed by Apple, and learn Swift. A modern language, whose conventions are still in their forming phase, and whose libraries and building blocks are still being developed. There is no such thing as idiomatic Swift yet, and I could play a role in how the language looks going forward.
Go functional, and learn Haskell, a language that, for all intents and purposes, I will never be able to use in production. This route would merely satisfy my intellectual curiosity, and give me a new way to think about computer scince 
Focus on mastering the old tools that I already know, and fully embrace Python.

However, any choice I make will happen under imperfect information: the implications of my choices are unknown to me, and I only know some approximation to the real outcome distribution. I won't understand the value of learning functional programming until I learn it.


As the number of books, movies, podcasts, TV shows, and blog posts available for our perusal has exploded, our ability to effectively decide what is worth spending time on has, by definition, decreased. While arguably there is an optimal content mix that satisfies our personal goals (a solution to our objective function), i
