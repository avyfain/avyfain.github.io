When my friend Jack asked me to "give a short talk about immigration and tech" a couple of years ago, 

? I read your blog post (amazing), and I can tell how passionately you feel about the topic.

What exactly you'd talk about would be up to you, but I figured something having to do with some of the background that's pertinent to current events would be a pretty powerful topic - what is an H1B visa, how work visa's work, how different tech companies around the bay have benefitted from immigration, and the impact that those tech-genius-immigrants have had on all of our lives.


    Obviously, I know that the government has a fat file on me and every other immigrant, but it produces a very strong reaction to actually see the multi-inch thick, yet only partial, stack of paper in person.
