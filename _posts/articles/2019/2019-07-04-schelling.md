I'm excited to be collabrating with Dirk Brockmann again, this time as part of his Complexity Explorables project. We built an interactive visualization of Schelling's model for geographical segregation of human communities.

Check out the [explorable visualization](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/t-schelling-plays-go/), and keep an eye out for others like it soon!
