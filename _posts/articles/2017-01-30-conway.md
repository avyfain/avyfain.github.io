Last year, I went on an intense conference talk binge. At first, I did it because I was excited to attend PyCon, so I watched as many talks from previous years as I could in preparation. Then, I was disappointed that I had missed it, and to make up for it decided to watch a bunch of new videos from the conference once they were released. [@tweetgameoflife](https://twitter.com/tweetgameoflife), my favorite side project from last year, was born from this binge.

In February, I watched Jack Diederich's talk [Stop Writing Classes](http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes) and challenged myself to code up my own implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). I got a very simple version running, and forgot the project for a few months. Fast forward a few months, and Terian Koscik's [Twitter Bot Fairy Tales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC9m2GInXqU&t=802s) lightning talk inspired me to make a bot out of it.

I don't remember the first time that I heard of Conway's game. Very likely, one of my friends posted an [epic YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE), and I clicked through, not knowing what I was looking at. 

How do complex systems come about? What are the rules that lead to intelligence? We have no idea, but we know that really strange and interesting behavior can emerge from seeminlgy simple rules. 

In [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), his 1979 epic on minds and machines, Douglas Hofstadter discusses the emergent behaviors that lead to what we understand as consciousness and intelligence: seemingly insignificant parts, connected via simple rules, end up acquiring the ability to "step outside of themselves" and see the whole picture[^1]. How, and why, this happens is one of the great open questions not only of biology, but also psychology, religion, computer science, and an endless number of other fields. After thousands of years of wondering, humans still can't fully grasp complexity and emergence.

> ... we all know that we human beings are composed of an enormous number of cells (around wenty-five trillion), and therefore that everything we do could in principle be described in terms of cells. Or it could even be described on the level of molecules. Most of us accept this in a rather matter-of-fact way; we go to the doctor, who looks at us on lower levels than we think of ourselves. We read about DNA and "genetic engineering" and sip our coffee. We seem to have reconciled these two inconceivably different pictures of ourselves simply by disconnecting them from each other. We have almost no way to relate a microscopic description of ourselves to that which we feel ourselves to be, and hence it is possible to store separate representations of ourselves in quite separate "compartments" of our minds. Seldom do we have to flip back and forth between these two concepts of ourselves, wondering "How can these two totally different things be the same me?"

Since the early days of computer science, researchers have studied ways to simulate intelligence. From Babbage's analytical engine, to Turing's tape driven machines, and Von Neumann's automata, the idea of building general purpose computer has eluded technologists. Even modern techniques falter in comparison to the minds of animals or toddlers.
