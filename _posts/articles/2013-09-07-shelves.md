During my summer internship in 2013, I had the opportunity to participate in TechCrunch Disrupt. I had very low expectations for the hackathon, since my coding abilities back then were very basic. Nevertheless, I teamed up with [Coders Clan](https://www.codersclan.net/)'s' founder and CEO, [Dror Cohen](https://twitter.com/drorco) and we built a simple book sharing application.

You can check out a video of our presentation, heavily influenced by the beginnings of the now ubiquitous "sharing economy" [here](http://techcrunch.com/video/shelves-demo-at-hackathon-sf-2013/517925708/).
