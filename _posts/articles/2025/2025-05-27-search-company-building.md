A few months ago, a founder in my network reached out for advice as he geared up to raise his seed round. We went through the usual tactical checklist—how to build a solid pitch deck and intro blurb, getting warm intros, managing the calendar chaos, and dealing with rejection. But since we were both technical, I steered the conversation toward a different mental model: treat your fundraise like a search problem.

I used to work on Search at Apple, where the tradeoff between precision and recall was everything. In most search products, you don’t want a hundred vaguely related results—you want the right one at the top. High precision, not high recall. And that’s exactly how founders should approach fundraising.

Too many early-stage founders try to maximize exposure. They build hit lists on spreadsheets, take every meeting, and treat VC interest like social proof. Meetings with VCs tickle our inner narcissism. It feels good to tell your friends you're talking to known names. There's a possibility that the conversations will go somewhere. At least in SF, that's a status symbol.

But most of those meetings don’t go anywhere—because they were never going to. The investor wasn’t a fit for your stage, space, or style. And instead of refining your pitch or moving the business forward, you just lost another hour to a polite pass. It's the VC's job to talk to you, and yours is to build your business. Every hour you spend pitching is an hour you are not solving the current challenge. There's a lot of commentary in founders' groups about whether you should talk to VC associates, but that's not what I'm talking about here. Sometimes talking to the associate is a good idea, but sometimes you should skip the meeting with the GP, too.

It’s easy to fall into the coverage trap. Taking meetings feels like progress, but a packed calendar isn’t the goal. The goal is to close great investors with the fewest meetings possible. That means being ruthlessly focused on match quality.

If you have a strong vision, half of the investors you talk to won't get it, but those are not the investors you want in the first place. Imagine you had access to pitch every fund in the world. Most would still be irrelevant. Many that should match on paper wouldn’t get what you're building. That’s fine. You only need the handful who do—who see your deck and think, _finally_. Those are the people you want on your cap table. So use your materials as filters to save you time, not as honey pots to bait anyone with cash.

This mindset applies well beyond fundraising. Recruiting, sales, partnerships—it all can be seen as information retrieval. You’re not broadcasting to everyone. You’re trying to surface the best possible match for what you’re building, right now.

Your role as a founder is to optimize for precision over recall. Not just in your RAG but in most things that matter.

<!-- Company building through the Search lens

A few months ago, a technical founder in my network asked for advice as he considered kicking off his seed fundraise. Below are some notes from our conversation.

As a founder, time is your most valuable resource. It's too easy to get distracted, and one of the most tempting ways to waste time is talking to investors. Meetings with VCs tickle our inner narcissism. It feels good to tell your friends you're talking to known names. There's a possibility that the conversations will go somewhere. At least in SF, that's a status symbol.

Early on, your only goal is to build your business, and every hour you spend pitching is an hour you are not building. There's a lot of commentary in founders' groups about whether you should talk to VC associates, but the focus what I'm talking about here - of course individual investors who know your space are ultimately who you should target, but founders often talk to totally wrong firms.

One way to think about this is through the lens of Search and information retrieval. There are hundreds of firms out there. Which ones operate in your space, and at your stage or geo?

Remember the goal is not to pitch as many investors as possible, but to close the best investors with the least number of pitch meetings. So don't aim for “coverage” and getting every investor to read the memo and take the meeting, but to instead have only the investors you care about, who “get it”, and make sure the memo answers what they would ask you


Agreed! One’s a clear cut vertical SaaS business with an LLM data extraction layer slapped on top, which to me has no moat, is easy-ish to replicate, and doesn’t seem all that novel, whereas the latter has a broader vision that’s much more ambitious. 


Assume you have access to pitch every investor. Your company might get lots of interest if you are in highly regarded programs like YC or Techstars, or niche ones like The Mint.

Your pitch should not try to please everyone. If you have a strong and differentiated vision, half of the investors you talk to won't get it, but those are not the investors you want in the first place.

Company Building Through the Search Lens

A few months ago, a founder in my network asked me for advice as he kicked off his seed fundraise. We talked about a lot of tactical stuff—approaching it as a sales funnel, writing a solid blurb, getting warm intros, and being ready to get a lot of no's—but since we were both technical, the main thing I tried to impress on him was this: You should treat your fundraise like an information retrieval problem. 

I used to work on Search at Apple. In Search, relevance is everything. You don't want every user to get 100 results to scroll through—you want them to tap the first one they see. High precision, not high coverage.

That’s exactly how you should think about fundraising. Or recruiting. Or selling. Optimize for engagement. As an early stage founder, time is your scarcest resource, and you should treat it like it.

Too many founders fall into the coverage trap. Pitching a bunch of firms feels like progress. You’re in motion, you’re name-dropping, you’re building a pipe. But most of those meetings don’t go anywhere. Because the investors weren’t a fit to begin with.

Worse, most founders don’t even define what a “fit” means. The investor landscape is massive. Stage, geography, check size, thesis, speed, conviction model—it all matters. Spray-and-pray works if you’re selling ads. It doesn’t work when you’re selling equity.

You want the deck and memo to filter out the wrong people. Make it sharp. Answer the questions your ideal investors will ask. Let the rest bounce. If everyone likes your pitch, it’s probably too soft.

Imagine you had access to pitch every fund in the world. Most of them would still be irrelevant. Some wouldn’t get it. Some wouldn’t care. You only want the handful who see what you see. Who lean in. Who say “I’ve been waiting for someone to build this.”

The right investors are rare. So don’t optimize for coverage. Optimize for match quality.

And this mindset applies way beyond fundraising. When you’re hiring, selling, partnering—it’s all the same problem. Matching. Relevance. Engagement.

Precision over recall. Every time.
