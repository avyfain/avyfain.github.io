title: Your Career is a Concentrated Portfolio

If there is one theme that has followed me over the last five years or so, and which I have not been able to get my mind off of, it is personal time allocation. Particularly, why it is worthwhile to spend time doing one thing versus another? Should we go deep, or go broad? Should we be [T-shaped people](https://web.archive.org/web/20110329003842/http://www.chiefexecutive.net/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications::Article&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=F42A23CB49174C5E9426C43CB0A0BC46), [paint drip people](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/paint-drip-people/1226700000696195/), or [experts in our field](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)?

Our personal ambitions tend to be unclear, and they change over time. Even at such a personal level, we make decisions based on imperfect information. In essence, each option we can choose from is a bet ex ante. We put time and effort behind learning a skill, just like money behind a stock, in hopes that it will have good returns later wihtout knowing the real distribution. However, unlike with the stock market, where you can (and should!) aim for diversification, your career is for the most part made of highly correlated skills. To make things worse, you can't rebalance your account! There is no such thing as an index fund for your career. The modern labor market is all about specialization.

Your career is a concentrated portfolio, but victims to path dependence. Once you pick something, you roll with it.

In some ways, you're selecting a handful of stocks, and hoping for the best. During some windows, like through further education, or tangentially related job opportunities, you might be able to de-risk, and diversify through new skills, but in the end, most of your stocks are still highly correlated.

Think about this when you pick your next book, your next project or your next team.
In the end, there is a finite amount of time for each of us to allocate.
