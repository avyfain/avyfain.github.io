So it's a bit over a year since I [wrote about writing](/articles/2015/10/13/not-first-post/). Has anything changed? Well, yes. I initially thought I'd be sharing many more blog posts about my own thoughts, but for some reason those all end up in half-baked Google docs. Hitting publish is hard. It is much easier to write one or two lines of commentary [on someone else's writing](/links), than to produce any essay worth sharing. But there is a gray area right next to content creation:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"Creation versus consumption" is such a narrow way to frame thinking about computing. I spend half of some days routing.</p>&mdash; Benedict Evans (@BenedictEvans) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/792872195013746688">October 30, 2016</a></blockquote>

Routing people to worthwhile content is possibly as important these days as creating the content itself - isn't that what Facebook and Twitter's algorithms do, after all? - and between a few pieces of content, mainly photos, and a blog post here and there, I went from 0-5 daily sessions to 20-40 daily sessions on this site in the last year.

Here's to more writing.
