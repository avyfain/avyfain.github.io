  - title: In San Francisco and Rooting for a Tech Comeuppance
    author: David Streitfeld
    source: The New York Times
    note: In a way, it is surreal to be living this first hand, knowing that I am part of the problem. How long can SF keep going without a policy change?

  - title: Valley VCs Sit on Cash, Forcing Startups to Dial Back Ambition

  - title: "Millions of ordinary Americans support Donald Trump. Here's why."
    author: Thomas Frank
    source: The Guardian
    url: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support
    note: "Very related to yesterday's Noah Smith article on Bernie, and last week's Stratechery on \"The Voters Decide\". Both Trump and Sanders appeal to a population that is not addressed by mainstream media."

  - title: The Data Sleuths of San José
    author: Christian Caryl
    source: Foreign Policy
    url: http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/27/the-data-sleuths-of-san-jose-costa-rica-corruption/
    note: I remember these events from when I was a kid, and it really interesting to see them exposed here again, a decade later, when I can actually understand them and their implications. I wonder what kind of data is available today, in Costa Rica and elsewhere, just waiting to be analyzed to uncover other schemes like these.
  - title: Data structures in JavaScript
    author: Benoît Vallon

    note: Javascript is a weird language. Period.
