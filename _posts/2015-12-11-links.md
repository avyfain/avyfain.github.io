Well, I finished the first season of Startup, and then, I got bored... Take note Alex Blumberg! The reasons why I was enjoying it so much were the SV outsider tone, the feeling of surprise when lingo had to be explained, and, perhaps most importantly, the fact that I listened to a whole season of Reply All before I started with StartUp. To me, Gimlet is just a more interesting business to learn about than Dating Ring (sorry matchmaker aficionados).

Now, since I always _NeedMoreContent™_, I started a [class on coursera](https://class.coursera.org/nand2tetris1-001) and it has been awesome to learn about the low level pieces that make up a computer. It's been less than a week since I started, and I am already halfway through week 4 of the course. The class is aimed at people with 0 engineering background, and I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in computing.
