This weekend I read two completely unrelated documents that have shaped, and in my opinion will continue to influence, the future of technology.

First, I read the [Bitcoin White Paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by the infamous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto). It is widely accepted that the release of this paper was a watershed moment in computer science and economics, as the mathematics backing the bitcoin network tackles big, previously unsolved, problems in  distributed systems, such as the [double spending problem](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending) and the [byzantine generals problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance). On the economic side, the technology could allow its users to skirt middlemen, lowering transaction costs, but its effects go way beyond that. Bitcoin's controlled supply takes expectations out of the inflation equation, by making credible claims on future currency issuance, preventing [seignorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage) and possibly improving [monetary policy](http://andolfatto.blogspot.com/2015/11/bitcoin-and-central-banking.html). The paper was much more accessible than I expected. It is a very interesting read, and it gives a concice high level view of the inner workings of BTC. After reading it, I have been playing with the idea of writing a simulation of the bitcoin network, stay tuned for that...

Next, I read the [Twelve Factor App](http://12factor.net), by Adam Wiggins and the folks behind [Heroku](heroku.com). Given that the first dynamic application I deployed online was a Ruby on Rails app on Heroku (thanks [Michael Hartl](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)!), a lot of the content seemed obvious to me. However after talking to some of my more experienced coworkers it was interesting to see how much of a paradigm shift cloud infrastructure has brought to the technology industry. This is reflected in company cultures, and in a way is discussed in the [First Round Review article](http://firstround.com/review/the-right-way-to-ship-software/) posted below.

The two documents could not have less in common, but I am certain that both will heavily impact the businesses and technology in years to come.
