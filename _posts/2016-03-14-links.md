    note: "New wealth flowing into a city, plus old wealth's \"build new things in other places\" attitude leads to gentrification. We're not in a bubble, but in a bifurcation, and SF has no relief valve to rely on. Only new city policies could change that."

  - title: "How to Code and Understand DeepMind's Neural Stack Machine"
    author: Andrew Trask
    url: https://iamtrask.github.io/2016/02/25/deepminds-neural-stack-machine/
    note: 'Academic papers tend to utilize terse language and jargon to precisely describe processes and outcomes, but these "precise" explanations end up being impenetrable walls for the uninitiated.

    Thankfully, there are bloggers like Trask, Olah, Karpathy, and others who lower the bar to understanding the intricacies of academic machine learning. I am still trying to get through this one. Trask definitely made the task accessible. The DeepMind researchers, on the other hand, did not.'
