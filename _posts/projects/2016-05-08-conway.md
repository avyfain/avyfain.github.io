In [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach), his 1979 epic on minds and machines, Douglas Hofstadter discusses the emergent behaviors that lead to what we understand as consciousness and intelligence: seemingly insignificant parts, connected via simple rules, end up acquiring the ability to "step outside of themselves" and see the whole picture.[^1]. How, and why, this happens is one of the great open questions not only of computer science, but biology, psychology, religion, and an endless number of fields. After thousands of years of wondering, humans still can't fully grasp complexity and emergence.

> ... we all know that we human beings are composed of an enormous number of cells (around wenty-five trillion), and therefore that everything we do could in principle be described in terms of cells. Or it could even be described on the level of molecules. Most of us accept this in a rather matter-of-fact way; we go to the doctor, who looks at us on lower levels than we think of ourselves. We read about DNA and "genetic engineering" and sip our coffee. We seem to have reconciled these two inconceivably different pictures of ourselves simply by disconnecting them from each other. We have almost no way to relate a microscopic description of ourselves to that which we feel ourselves to be, and hence it is possible to store separate representations of ourselves in quite separate "compartments" of our minds. Seldom do we have to flip back and forth between these two concepts of ourselves, wondering "How can these two totally different things be the same me?"

Since the early days of computer science, researchers have studied ways to simulate intelligence. From Babbage's analytical engine, to modern AI techniques du jour, the idea of building a general purpose computer     

, mathematicians had to make use physical objects for their theorizing. Most used pen and paper, but a young professor at Cambridge decided to spend his hours studying the black and white stones of Go.

You can find some inspiration [here](http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex.htm"). Just make sure you only include new lines and the characters "O" (capital o) and "." (period), anything else will be ignored.
