Two very unexpected things I learned from this piece: 1) San Francisco's homeless population has been around 6000 for over 25 years. 2) between nonprofits and city departments, $241M/year are spent on supporting San Francisco's homeless population. That is, roughly $40k per person."

    note: "As usual, Thoma asks the right questions. I am particularly interested in the \"how is the social interest is defined?\" aspect of his article. When companies, and identities, span across the world, our definitions of society change too."
