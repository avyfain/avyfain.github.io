  - title: How Slack and Facebook Are Making Access to Information Less Democratic

    note: There are clear tensions regarding how information is stored and accessed on the internet. In the OSS world, there is a loud group that constantly complains about the IRC => Slack trend, for example. Whether the fringe is becoming more or less accessible, I don't know, I have not tried to hang out there, but there is an overwhelming feeling of the walls closing in on themselves.

    note: The fact that this is not clearer to the public at large is insane. It is a bizarre time to live.

    note: Internalize your mistakes, correct your course, but don't forget you messed up.

  - title: What San Francisco Says About America
    author: Thomas Fuller
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/what-san-francisco-says-about-america.html
    note: I lived in Chicago for 4 years, and I never saw levels of poverty and homelessness as intense as I see in San Francisco. However, both cities have poverty. Both cities have homelessness. In Chicago it is a matter of "out of sight, out of mind", while in SF you see it day in and day out. Market Street and the Magnificent Mile are a stark contrast, but both cases require society to provide solutions. This article is missing a call to action.

    author: Devin Leonard
    source: Bloomberg
    url: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-21/spotify-is-perfecting-the-art-of-the-playlist
    note: Probably one of the best features in Spotify. Pretty cool story of how it came about.

  - title: Snapchat Releases First Hardware Product, Spectacles
    author: Seth Stevenson
    source: The Wall Street Journal
    url: http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-releases-first-hardware-product-spectacles-1474682719
    note: A glimpse into the future of media/advertising, an interesting personal story, and a product I'd love to try. The back story of how this story got leaked by Business Insider, and the WSJ ended up being whipped into releasing it early says a lot about journalism in the 21st century, too. A lot to unpack.

    author: Andrew Sullivan
    source: New York Magazine

    note: Another piece about the perils of living attached to our screens, and taking a break from the addiction. These have become more and more common, but somehow Sullivan gives a refreshing view.

    note: I wish I understood licensing better, but this is a first step. Open source software is amazing. It is one of the reasons computers today are as powerful as they are.

    note: Another cool project on image processing by Zucker. Code that solves a real problem, however tiny, is always worth reading.
