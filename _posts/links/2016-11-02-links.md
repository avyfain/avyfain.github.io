  - title: "Uncertainty Wednesday: Limits on Explanations (Turing and Gödel)"
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/152638520930/uncertainty-wednesday-limits-on-explanations
    note: Whether we like it or not, Turing and Gödel proved that there is irreducible uncertainty in the world, and when we build models and explanations, we need to keep that in mind.

  - title: What else are we getting wrong?
    author: Dan Ghica
    url: http://danghica.blogspot.com/2016/09/what-else-are-we-getting-wrong.html
    note: I agree with Ghica. We need research into whether strong, static type systems help or hurt. When do we pick which? The issue is that any empirical study would have to control for training, use case, and many other variables. The end result would be to artificially recreate industry, which is basically impossible.

    note: The argument is easy, make it cheaper to take risks, and more people will take risks. Incentives.

  - title: An Email History of the 2001 iPod Launch
    author: Steven Levy

    note: 15 years went by quickly. I remember my first iPod, back in 2004. Hearing a bit of what the future looked like back then is worthwhile.

  - title: "The iPad: it’s for everyone else (2010)"
    author: Ben Thompson

    url: https://stratechery.com/2010/the-ipad-its-for-everyone-else/
    note: History definitely rhymes! "...here’s the deal. Most people aren’t power users" is exactly what I've been thinking the past 5 days after the Mac release event. I am convinced that this generation of MBPs will sell well. Even if I am not buying one, the majority will.

    note: Don't be a generalist, and don't be T-shaped. Be a paint drip.

    note: Not much needs to be said about this, but Mark Suster makes great arguments about why backing Trump is completely wrong.

  - title: "Behind the Mask: Scenes From Nicaragua's Sandinista Revolution"
    author: James Estrin
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/behind-the-mask-scenes-from-nicaraguas-sandinista-revolution/
    note: Growing up in Costa Rica, I somewhat lived with the after-effects of the revolution. A large portion of the population in Costa Rica is from Nicaragua (somewhere between 5%-10%, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmigraci%C3%B3n_nicarag%C3%BCense_en_Costa_Rica">according to Wikipedia</a>) and while I have heard some stories, and learned a bit about this in school, I feel like I should make an effort and learn the history of my own "other".

    source: a16z (podcast)
    url: http://a16z.com/2016/10/29/pc-devices-architectures-ecosystems/
    note: The big question about technology today is who will be the leader for the next platform. As usual, great insights from the Andreessen Horowitz hallway.
