  - title: Software Systems in a World of LLMs
    author: Davis Treybig
    note: One of the most thoughtful pieces I've read about looking forward and the changes coming from AI. Treybig doesn't focus on societal changes, but changes to the production of software systems themselves. Programming languages, development frameworks, and libraries are tools built to make it easier for humans to read and write code. Soon we'll start seeing new ideas popping up here to make it easier for LLMs to read and write code, too.

  - title: AI and the American Smile
    author: Jenka Gurfinkel
    note: An interesting observation of cultural differences, looking at AI generated selfies to explain how nuance and slight variation get papered over by ML models. Training datasets make a huge difference in the output we see. A different flavor of the world globalizing and flattening, and the loss from that process.

  - title: What literature do we study from the 1990s?
    author: Matt Daniels
    source: The Pudding
    note: An analysis of university curricula and Goodreads reviews to understand the infleunce of books written in the 90s, and how we perceive them today.

  - title: The Perils of Prudence
    author: Abraham Thomas
    note: Paradoxically, going faster can sometimes be the less risky move. This is true in startup-land, but also in Antarctic exploration.

  - title: Multi-layered calendars
    author: Julian Lehr
    note: Exploring different UX ideas for how to improve calendars. I hate both Google and Apple calendar, and would love to try something like this out.

  - title: AI and the automation of work
    author: Benedict Evans
    note: Automation, and thinking of LLMs as an army of interns who can perform most tasks reasonably with some supervision. Evans drives us towards Jevons' Paradox, pointing that the falling cost of getting some things done with LLMs actually increases demand for those things, increasing, rather than reducing our use of them. From coal, to oil, Xerox machines, and typewriters... why is this time different?

  - title: A Petabyte of Health Insurance Prices Per Month
    author: Adam Geitgey
    source: Turquoise Health
    note: On data engineering, redundancy, and "looking for hundreds of needles in a haystack approximately the size of Mars." Reminds me of my Apple days, and the challenges of working in insanely large scale systems. Turquoise is working on some cool stuff.

  - title: Remote work blew $484M hole in SF tax haul, report finds
    author: Joe Eskenazi
    source: Mission Local
    note: A few crazy stats about WFH and the evolution of post-pandemic SF. GDP keeps going up, but the concentration of large companies driving tax revenues puts the city at risk – the largest 100 companies (.7% of the total) account for nearly 60% of the business tax collected. Interesting to see SF politicians realize that Laffer curves are not idiotic.

  - title: '"Low-Resource" Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors'
    author: Zhiying Jiang, Matthew Yang, Mikhail Tsirlin, Raphael Tang, Yiqin Dai, and Jimmy Lin
    source: Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics
    note: A 14 line python script with 0 parameters that can outperform a bunch of the deep transformer-based LLM models everyone is so crazy about.

  - title: Excuse me, is there a problem?
    author: Jason Cohen
    source: A Smart Bear
    note: Most companies fail because they don't solve actual problems. This is a good problem sizing framework, based on his experience building WP Engine.

  - title: Hashing
    author: Sam Rose
    note: A visualization of hashing functions, what they are and what makes a good one. This would have been a great resource back when I was taking intro to programming classes.

  - title: Building LLM applications for production
    author: Chip Huyen
    note: Most LLM applications I've seen so far are still just demoware, things that look cool and shiny but don't really work at scale. This piece is a few months old, and good chunks of it already feel outdated.

    author: Max Woolf
    note: A post pointing out problems with one of the most popular frameworks in AI-land these days, and the perils of [picking the wrong abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction).

  - title: Changing my mind on remote, moving the team back to San Francisco
    author: Flo Crivello
    note: I'm bullish distributed-teams long term as companies grow, but early-on technical teams working on startups should be in one place, and that place should be San Francisco.

    author: Megan Cassidy and Gabrielle Lurie
    source: San Francisco Chronicle
    note: Part one of a very in depth report on the connection between Honduran migrants and San Francisco's drug crisis. A strange, sad story about international trade, drug markets, and immigration.

I'll try to start posting links on a semi-regular basis, and make a habit of it again. Here's a few bits I've read recently. Too many of them are about LLMs and Generative AI. Please help me change that — send good long-form my way.
