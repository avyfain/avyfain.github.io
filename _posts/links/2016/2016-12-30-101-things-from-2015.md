description: Yeah, that's not a typo. You're in for a few throwbacks. Last January I compiled a list of the best content I had read over the year. With 2016 almost over, I was about to repeat the exercise, and noticed I never shared my v1. Luckily, most pieces have aged well.

{{ page.description }}

2015 was a year of choices and change for me: I moved from school in Chicago to full-time work in San Francisco. The selected articles are a good reflection of my mindset then, but after reading through the titles, I was suprised by how many of these I keep bringing up in conversation today. It is remarkable that I could remember where and when I read the majority of the pieces, two years later.

Below is a mix of longform, essays, quick notes, blog posts, interviews and other journalism representing the kind of work I enjoy on technology, business, science and economics, plus the few stray random topics. Since you're here, I'll assume you're familiar.

In alphabetical order:

{% assign sorted_articles = page.articles | group_by:"author" | sort:"name" %}
<ol>
{% for author in sorted_articles %}
    {% assign articles = author.items | sort:"title" %}
    {% for article in articles %}
      <li class="article-link">
        <a href='{{ article.url }}' onclick="trackOutboundLink('{{ article.url }}'); return true;" target="_blank">
          {{ article.title }}
        </a>
        <br>
        <small><em>
        {{article.author_first}} {{author.name}} - {{article.source}}
        </em></small>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
</ol>
