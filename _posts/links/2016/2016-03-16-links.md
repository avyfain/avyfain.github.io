  - title: The Amazon Tax
    author: Ben Thompson

    note: "An extremely bullish case from a former Amazon bear. Ben's writing is usually great, but this one takes the prize for clarity: connecting the dots from Bezos' famous letter to shareholders in 1997 to the beginnings of AWS in 2006, to today. A must read."
  - title: "Ping21: Earn Bitcoin by Monitoring Uptime and Latency"
    author: Tyler Pate, Andrew DeSantis, Eli Haims, David Harding, and Balaji S. Srinivasan

    note: Very seriously considering buying one of these. Seems like the investment would pay for itself with a few hours of tinkering.

  - title: Handful of Biologists Went Rogue and Published Directly to Internet
    author: Amy Harmon
    source: The New York Times
    note: "An interesting account of incentives at work. Nobel prize winners, and other already well-known scientist, do not care about the prestige of the important journals, so they get to publish directly. Young, unknown, scientists on the other hand, are stuck with the old, considerably inferior, publishing system to prove their worth."

  - title: The Changing Value Of ARR
    author: Alex Wilhelm
    source: Mattermark
    url: https://mattermark.com/changing-value-of-arrrrrrrr/
    note: "On one hand, the article makes good use of historical data to make a clear point: SaaS has been hit hard by the markets, both public and private. On the other hand, the URL makes good use of pirate jokes."

    note: Some things about this country are still baffling to me.
