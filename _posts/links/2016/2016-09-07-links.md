  - title: Knowledge (2015)

    note: In this post, Albert defines knowledge from a humanistic perspective. It nicely ties into a recent article I shared about <a href="http://www.meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/">nihilism</a>. Knowledge only matters if it is worth reproducing.

    note: Slowly, one abstraction at a time, software engineering has become more and more accessible. The advent of Ruby on Rails marked the beginning of a wave that lowered the barriers to entry for programming, particularly web development, for thousand of engineers. I am one of them. Now it is time to put in the hours and master the craft.

  - title: "Story of My Life: How Narrative Creates Personality"

    note: We contain multitudes. Our idea of the "self" is just an aggregate of layers of all previous actions and states of mind, wrapped in a narrative that also changes over time. It'd be an interesting exercise to try and model this computationally, somehow.

    note: Real innovation takes time. It is, however, important to remember that cycles are contracting. Innovation itself is <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CrwxSD0UAAAvGIX.jpg">accelerating</a>, and that needs to go into our decision making models, too.

  - title: How Apple Helped Create Ireland’s Economies, Real and Fantastical

    note: The events that are developing in the EU right now are potentially more important to the future of global culture than most people realize. Whatever conclusion comes from this case might define sovereignty and jurisdiction across national and supranational borders. As Tim Cook posits in his <a href="http://www.apple.com/ie/customer-letter/">letter</a>, "at its root, the Commission’s case is not about how much Apple pays in taxes. It is about which government collects the money," and that is the actually interesting question here.
