  - title: "I know how to program, but I don't know what to program"
    author: Nano Dano

    note: "Through an analogy between learning CS, and how to play musical instruments, the author explains the value of reinventing the wheel: cloning other people's projects allows you to learn useful patterns as you go. Start by mimicking, and continue adding your own features. The important part is putting your fingers to work. For example, I got my start with <a href=\"http://railstutorial.org\">Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial</a>, and modified it bit by bit to fit my needs. One of the best pieces I have read on how to \"level up\" as a software engineer."

  - title: The Curse of Culture
    author: Ben Thompson
    source: Stratechery
    note: "Culture is fascinating, but also really subjective, making it hard to quantify, or analyze. To make it worse, it is turtles all the way down: culture matters at the company, division, group, team and individual basis, and the larger the company the more culture solidifies as a \"thing\" that makes that company what it is."

    author: Fred Ehrsam
    source: The Coinbase Blog
    url: https://medium.com/the-coinbase-blog/ethereum-is-the-forefront-of-digital-currency-5300298f6c75
    note: 'It takes guts to describe your company as the "...most popular way to buy, sell, and use bitcoin" or, more humbly, a "bitcoin wallet and platform" and then come out and say that something else is better, and possibly more sustainable, than BTC. Smells like a soft pivot to cryptocurrencies in general could be coming.'
