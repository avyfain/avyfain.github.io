I haven't read much lately. I checked my stats today (yes, I keep track of how many articles I read) and my rolling one week daily average is about to hit 1 article read per day. That is scary, because I don't know what is consuming my time in place of my usual online reading.

It might be [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avyfain), and [the](https://twitter.com/alinkplease) [bots](https://twitter.com/tweetgameoflife), but that doesn't add up in my head.
