  - title: The Case Against Reality
    author: Amanda Gefter
    source: The Atlantic
    note: I have <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/did-humans-evolve-to-see-things-as-they-really-are/">linked to</a> Hoffman's work before, and encouraged some of my friends to read <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/interface.pdf">his research</a>. I think Gefter did a great job with this interview.

  - title: Neural Networks Are Impressively Good At Compression
    source: Probably Dance

    note: A good explanation of neural networks by example. It is amazing how quickly the toy problem of learning a couple of weights, basic high school math, becomes untractable.

  - title: Handcuffed to Uber
    author: Connie Loizos

    note: "Most of modern economics is based on the idea that people make decisions with a clear understanding of the consequences. This couldn't be further from the truth. Whether we're talking of switching to a new job, moving to a different state, picking an insurance plan or making a donation, there are always economic consequences that people don't understand. The complexity of our world, some of it designed, some of it emergent, makes rational decision-making almost impossible. These Uber employees were definitely not aware of how big of an issue this policy would be years after they joined the company. (For more on the topic, take a look at <a href='https://zachholman.com/posts/fuck-your-90-day-exercise-window/'> Zach Holman's post</a>.)"
