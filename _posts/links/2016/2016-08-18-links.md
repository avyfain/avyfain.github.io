    author: Mike Roberts
    source:
    url: http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html
    note: '"Serverless" is the Next Big Thing. Serve static stuff on S3, make everything stateless, and plug a bunch of functions in Lambda. AWS once again changing the paradigm.'

  - title: The hedgehog and the fox
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/7/12/the-hedgehog-and-the-fox
    note: I like to think of myself as a much more fox-ey than hedgehog-ey person, and I think success comes from getting a fox to surround themselves with hedgehogs. This is true in the AI context, as well as many others. "To think about tech now is to think about many things."

    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/147764393975/what-did-you-do-what-will-i-have-done
    note: While the comparisons with WWII are extreme, this is one of those "better safe than sorry" situations. Go vote, I can't.

  - title: Watch this very chill video of virtual soft-bodied creatures swimming underwater
    author: James Vincent
    source: The Verge
    url: http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12105224/soft-bodied-underwater-evolution
    note: Some really <a href="https://bitbucket.org/fcorucci/alife2016_evolvinggrowingsoftrobots.git">cool research</a> by Francesco Corucci et al.

  - title: "The Uber Engineering Tech Stack, Part I: The Foundation"
    author: Lucie Lozinski
    source: Uber Engineering Blog
    url: https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/
    note: It is always interesting to see how others do things. Especially interesting is the migration from python/node to Java/Go, and the heavy usage of OSS projects. I agree that having less languages is good, however, this might be a bit quixotic.

  - title: "Central bank digital currency: the end of monetary policy as we know it?"
    author: Marilyne Tolle
    source: Bank Underground
    url: https://bankunderground.co.uk/2016/07/25/central-bank-digital-currency-the-end-of-monetary-policy-as-we-know-it/
    note: One of the most intriguing aspects of bitcoin is what kind of effects a constant, predictable, and stable money supply would cause in our financial systems. Coming from the Bank of England, this post holds more water than the usual cryptocurrency wonk posts.

    author: Paul Krugman
    source: The New York Times

    note: The world is a mess, its just less messy than it used to be.

    author: Paul Krugman
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/the-unbundled-city/
    note: Not the usual Krugman. A really interesting take on how the Internet has changed cities. While he thinks of "back office operations," I think of AWS and outsourced manufacturing.

    note: Related, and somewhat more in depth, is the a16z <a href="http://a16z.com/2016/08/02/emoji/">podcast on emoji</a>. Why do these icons carry so much weight?

    author: Yuval Harari
    source: Haaretz (Paywall)
    url: http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.733913
    note: Exceptionalism is not just an American problem.<br>The only way I was able to get around the paywall was to click on the link from Facebook Messenger, which adds a referrer to the HTTP request. Let me know if you find another workaround.

    note: "Leadership is hard, and requires personal sacrifice. People appreciate that, and can tell when a person in power doesn't put in the required effort. According to Woehr, Marissa did."

Hello there old friends. It has been forever since my last post, and I apologize for that. Here is a mixed bag of technology, management, and politics pieces. My interests haven't changed, hopefully yours haven't either.

Expect more frequent updates coming back soon.
