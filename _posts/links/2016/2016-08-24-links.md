  - title: The Unicorn Hedge
    author: Dave McClure
    source: 500 Hats

    note: As software seeps into our daily lives, everything becomes "tech". I don't like that word, it is too broad, and somewhat meaningless. A truck is technology. So is a self-driving truck, but the latter does much more by leveraging software. Every "traditional" company in some capacity uses "tech", and as time goes on more and more firms depend on software for their daily operations. This is at the root of the reality that McClure describes. AirBnB is considered a "tech" company, but it should be compared against Hilton and Marriott, not against Google and Apple. That's their actual competition. The hedge is real, and it is only a symptom of the overall trend towards a fully software enabled industry.

  - title: Programming without Programmers? Aka Software Eating Software Development?
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/149417761835/programming-without-programmers-aka-software
    note: Software engineering, and the tools required for it, have evolved significantly over time. Barriers to entry have been lowered, making programming accessible for "normal" people, both in terms of monetary costs as well as in the amount of effort required to get started and build something significant. For better or for worse, modern programming languages are english-like enough that they can be grokked by children. Writing machine or assembly language can be seen as an esoteric exercise by today's standards. On the shoulders of giants, we've climbed up several levels on the ladder of abstraction, and as Wenger implies, this is not stopping any time soon.

  - title: Understanding VCs
    author: Fred Wilson
    source: AVC
    note: The "PR angle" Fred talks about is true of the blogs of VCs, startups, programmers, journalists, and pretty much any other piece of content on the web, even including this curated set of links. We should cast wide nets, and get information from every possible source before making decisions. Remember other people are driven by incentives just as much as ourselves.

  - title: Penny Auctions - How to sell a $180 tablet for $7,264
    source: Curious Gnu
    url: http://www.curiousgnu.com/penny-auctions
    note: Whether penny auctions can be classified as gambling or not, they could be a source of really interesting decision theory/behavioral economics research. If you know of any studies particularly worth looking at, please send them my way.

  - title: Milwaukee's Divide Runs Right Through Me
    author: Bassey Etim
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/milwaukees-divide-runs-right-through-me.html
    note: Over the last few weeks, I started watching The Wire. The longer I live in this country, the more I understand the tensions around race and class rooted in years and years of history. I want to spend more time reading about this, and exploring the narratives of the various sides. Building empathy is hard work.

    note: A follow-up on last week's post on Docker, and the state of distributed systems on the web. This one being the non-satirical version.

    author: Jan Dawson
    source: Medium
    url: https://medium.com/beyond-devices/five-years-of-tim-cooks-apple-in-charts-9e5488f48fce
    note: "Being on the inside, I can't say much about this, other than: I'm still bullish."

  - title: But What If We're Wrong
    author: Russ Roberts and Chuck Klosterman
    source: EconTalk
    url: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/08/chuck_klosterma.html
    note: Lots of interesting tid bits on culture, and how our perception of the world changes over time. What will we look back in N years and think "wow, how were we so stupid"?

  - title: Slavery and Racism
    author: Russ Roberts and Michael Munger
    source: EconTalk
    url: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/08/munger_on_slave.html
    note: The fact that two white economics professors at prestigious universities talk about this in public is already a big win. Not knowing the history of slavery in the US, this was quite interesting. The "us vs. them" framing, coupled with the Rawlsian ideas towards the end, was the most persuasive part. Incentives strike again.

  - title: On Average
    author: Roman Mars
    source: 99% Invisible

    note: Had never thought about the fact that someone had to have introduced "average" into our culture. Another great episode from the 99pi team.
