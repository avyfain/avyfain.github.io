  - title: What Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?
    author: Jochen Bittner
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/opinion/what-do-trump-and-marx-have-in-common.html
    note: TL;DR, they were both "Wutbürgers," or "Angry Citizens." I don't think they had much else in common. Despite the poorly chosen title, the article does a good job of recounting previous political movements driven by anger, some more constructive than others, and showing how history echoes across time, as well as geography.

  - title: The Great Cooling Off
    author: Kim-Mai Cutler
    source: Modern Luxury, San Francisco
    url: http://modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-great-cooling
    note: Are we at the tail end of the up-cycle in San Francisco? The economic indicators make it seem like we might be. With rents flattening over the past few months, and unicorns falling from their sky-high valuations, the Bay Area might become a little less insane in the near future.

  - title: It’s Trump’s Party
    author: Paul Krugman
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/opinion/its-trumps-party.html
    note: It will be interesting to see what happens with the Republican Party after Trump. Many key players have lost their credibility, but, sadly, I don't think that really matters.

  - title: Static typing will not save us from broken software
    author: David R. MacIver
    url: http://www.drmaciver.com/2016/10/static-typing-will-not-save-us-from-broken-software/
    note: Writing software is a matter of trade-offs. There are costs to runtime errors, but there are also costs to over engineering. In the end, each feature, and each project ends up mixing and matching processes and strategies, but I haven't seen types pay-off their upfront expenses yet. Someone should spend the time modeling these choices in an economic model. I am sure several companies would be willing to fund such research.

  - title: The secret behind Italy’s rarest pasta
    author: Eliot Stein
    source: BBC
    url: http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20161014-the-secret-behind-italys-rarest-pasta
    note: I want to eat this. On a more serious note, I think the most interesting part of this story is how a very specific skill, which has been passed down as a secret through generations is about to be lost because of lack of interest, and indifference.

  - title: A Tale of Two Stagnations
    author: Noah Smith
    source: Bloomberg View
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-20/a-tale-of-two-stagnations
    note: "Consider two very different options for why growth seems to have stoped: either people have stopped consuming enough to drive the economy forward, or we have stopped innovating and creating products as we used to. Each situation requires very different remedial policies, but as Smith explains, we're not sure which of the two worlds we're living in."

  - title: The stock market looks cheap
    author: Antonio Fatas
    url: http://fatasmihov.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-stock-market-looks-cheap.html
    note: One of the few things about finance that I actually enjoyed learning about in school was Gordon's Growth Model. In his post, Fatas applies the model and plays with the equation to come up with a "Bubble Index." While I wouldn't bet on it, the equation makes for an interesting exercise.

  - title: Contempt Culture
    author: Aurynn Shaw
    source: The Particular Finest
    url: http://blog.aurynn.com/contempt-culture
    note: Holding others in contempt for not working with a <i>real language</i> is a problem. Putting down PHP, a commonplace occurence, is as bad as mocking Java for having <i>industrial strength</i>. As a Python guy, I constantly get comments on when I'll <i>graduate</i> to a static language. Making fun of each other's tools of choice, and marking them as being beneath consideration is a mistake.

  - title: Jane Jacobs’s Theories on Urban Planning—and Democracy in America
    author: Nathaniel Rich
    source: The Atlantic
    url: http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/11/the-prophecies-of-jane-jacobs/501104/
    note: I was first exposed to Jane Jacobs through a class in college. We were assigned an excerpt of "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," and it was odd how much Jacobs' line of thought, once extranous, was so internalized into our own views that many of us didn't understand why her writing was interesting. After learning more about her, and putting things in historical perspective, it all made much more sense.

  - title: Shadowed Qualities
    source: Startup (podcast)
    url: https://gimletmedia.com/episode/shadowed-qualities-season-4-episode-3/
    note: While I don't yet know the pressures of being CEO, it is well known that depression, anxiety, and other issues are common among the startup crowd. Gotta hand it to Alex Blumberg for exposing himself as he did in this episode. It takes courage to let others into one's life as he did.

  - title: The No-Brainer Economic Platform
    source: Planet Money (podcast)
    url: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/10/26/499490275/episode-387-the-no-brainer-economic-platform
    note: "People do not understand second order effects, and have trouble forseeing policy implications. I keep going back to how whenever we think of economics in terms of the study of \"rational agents,\" we're making a mistake. And I don't mean it in the behavioral econ \"we all have biases\" way, but in the \"People are dumb and don't have full information to make rational decisions\" way. Democracy is hard."
