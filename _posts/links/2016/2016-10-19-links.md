  - title: Developer hiring and the market for lemons
    author: Dan Luu
    url: http://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/
    note: "A critique of Spolsky's <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/FindingGreatDevelopers.html\">Finding Great Developers</a>, based on solid microeconomics. Luu compares the software engineering labor market to Akerlof's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons\">market for lemons</a>. The argument against Spolsky's model seems to be based on two ideas: first, that there is an information asymmetry for both hiring managers, as well as engineers, and second, that the proportion of dysfunctional teams is larger than Spolsky implies. The article goes into an extensive study of the market structure, and possible solutions for both managers and engineers. The main takeaway, is that job hunting and hiring for software engineers is hard."

  - title: The White Problem
    author: Quinn Norton

    note: An explainer on race in the US, which I can't recommend enough. Norton's two part post helped me re-contextualize the present via history I was unaware of (part two, <a href="https://medium.com/message/how-white-people-got-made-6eeb076ade42">here</a>).

  - title: Echo, interfaces and friction
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/10/10/echo-interfaces-and-friction
    note: We are nowhere near a transparent general AI, and all the companies buidling voice interfaces know that. By now, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have all been positioned away from such an all-encompassing solution, pushing for ever narrower use cases. Like the AIs out of Facebook's bot fiasco of 2016, voice interfaces seem to be adding more friction than they take away.

  - title: An Economics Nobel for Examining Reality
    author: Noah Smith
    source: Bloomberg View
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-10/an-economics-nobel-for-examining-reality
    note: "When people think of economics as a discipline, they tend to think of the broad themes they read about in the newspaper: interest rates, trade, unemployment, the housing market, etc, usually analyzed at the macro level. However, as Smith points out, microeconomics has slowly gained steam, developing more reliable models than macro in the last few years. Better tools, new methods, as well as data, are driving this change. Not surprisingly, this has resulted in more Nobel Prizes going to the microeconomists as of late, including <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-10/economics-nobel-rewards-theories-worth-building-on\">this year's winners</a>."

    url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/05/half-a-million-brazilians-want-to-break-away-and-form-a-new-country/
    note: More of the same. I still believe modern nations might be unraveling. Another case of "<em>we</em> don't want to pay for <em>them</em>, because they are not <em>us</em>".

  - title: The Hard Raise
    author: Fred Wilson
    source: AVC
    url: http://avc.com/2016/10/the-hard-raise/
    note: From an anecdote of a "hard raise," I think what Wilson makes in this post is an argument against easy money. When companies persevere against hard conditions, they come out stronger, with smarter theses, and better strategies.

    author: Narayana Kocherlakota
    source: Bloomberg View
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-11/how-the-fed-turns-good-news-into-bad
    note: In which Kocherlakota explains so much of what's wrong with techno-pessimism, while making a case for paying attention to second and third order effects.

    author: David Leonhardt
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/11/opinion/a-great-fight-of-our-times.html
    note: Throughout history, not all generations get to be better off than the previous ones, and that seems to be the case of the United States today... unless things change. "The moral case for a fairer society is clear. But there is also a self-interested case."

    note: I have been thinking a lot about Maslow's hierarchy as of late. Luckily, I am part of the minority that gets to worry about these things.

  - title: A Short Primer On The Thiel Dust-Up
    author: Alex Wilhelm
    source: Mattermark
    url: https://mattermark.com/short-primer-peter-thiel-trump-yc-dustup/
    note: Tech Twitter blew up on YC's face this week. It is rare for tech celebrities like David Heinemeier Hansson, Marco Arment, Thomas Ptacek, Jeff Atwood, and even Maciej Cegłowski to agree on things, but they have all come out with pitchforks after Sam Altman and Paul Graham for their defense of Peter Thiel. Even if Hillary wins, Trump has put strain on the Silicon Valley technorati.

    source: EconTalk (Podcast)
    url: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/10/angus_deaton_on.html
    note: "Not suprisingly, the idea of redistribution is not taken well by Roberts, but the underlying themes are more interesting anyway. Touching on cosmopolitanism, identity, and other recurring subjects of this blog, Deaton and Roberts discuss the state of the US's poor, questioning whether a poor person in the south is objectively worse off than a poor person in Africa, for example."

    url: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/10/07/497084491/episode-728-the-wells-fargo-hustle
    note: The stories coming out of the Wells Fargo scandal are rough. Incentives in the financial markets are turned on their heads, and it is amazing that the extensive regulation can't handle these issues. Golden parachutes and bail-outs aside, this is insanity.

    source: 99% Invisible (Podcast)
    url: http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/half-a-house/
    note: Necessity is the mother of invention, quite literally. This episode makes it easy to imagine what the village might look like, but after seeing the photos I think the audio doesn't do it justice. An excellent idea, and an important example of why the US sometimes lags on the innovation side.

    note: A short episode, based on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/02/negro-queue-in-mississippi-is-symbol-of-frustration-in-voter-registration-drive.html">a 1964 New York Times article</a>. Nate DiMeo tells us a story we've all heard before, but which, sadly, must be retold over and over again.

    note: I am sharing this, even though I honestly did not read the whole thing. An 11 part epic on how the internet works. A good production, even if a bit overwhelming.

As my friend Leo <a href="https://leocarvajal.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/pico-blanco/">would say</a>, my lack of link-posting has been circumstantial, not intentional.

Last week found me busy, and uninspired. The weekend, on the other hand, gave me a lot to think about. I listened to the audio-book version of Ta-Nehisi Coates' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_the_World_and_Me">Between the World and Me</a>, and watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5895028/">13th</a>, both of which I would highly recommend. I also attended a few <a href="http://www.litquake.org/">LitQuake</a> events, one of which was <a href="https://litcrawlsanfrancisco2016.sched.org/event/7zhW/the-beat-within-presents-young-voices-behind-bars">especially worthwhile</a>.

For a while now, I have been saying that I want to write more, and this weekend gave me even more ideas, as it put a lot of things in perspective. The goal for the upcoming weeks is to put my thoughts down on paper.

Also, I read <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/mormons/498506/">a</a> <a href="http://qz.com/805918/why-donald-trumps-access-hollywood-tape-was-the-last-straw-for-paul-ryan-and-the-gop/">bunch</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/us/politics/trump-election-rigging.html">of</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/upshot/actually-many-inner-cities-are-doing-great.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-candidacy-message-to-political-leaders-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-10">things</a> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-trumps-rise-mean-liberalisms-end">about</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/opinion/sunday/if-hillary-clinton-groped-men.html">the</a> <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/second-presidential-debate.html">election</a>, but you're probably tired of that. I am too.

In the mean time, here are links worth reading.
