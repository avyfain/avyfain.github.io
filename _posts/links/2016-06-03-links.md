  - title: What Tech Workers Can Learn From Harry Bridges
    author: Kelsey Gilmore-Innis
    url: http://nerd.kelseyinnis.com/blog/2016/01/06/what-tech-workers-can-learn-from-harry-bridges/
    note: San Francisco and the Gold Rush, both old and new. Labor, unions, and narratives of success.
  - title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels"
    author: Andrej Karpathy
    url: http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/
    note: "Another in depth look at modern solutions to artificial intelligence and problem solving. As usual, Karpathy makes complex ideas understandable, this time using OpenAI's Gym to play Pong."
  - title: Video is the new HTML
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/4/4/video-is-the-new-html
    note: HTML, Flash, Video, etc, are only a medium. Corporations today are working hard to exploit these new means of distribution.
  - title: Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants
    author: Farhad Manjoo
    source: The New York Times

  - title: Can social science yield objective knowledge?
    author: Noah Smith
    source: Noahpinion
    url: http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/06/can-social-science-yield-objective.html
    note: Great analogy between natural science vs. religion and natural science vs. social science. As Noah points out, the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">"God of the Gaps"</a> fits in quite well. I have long been a fan of Paul Davies and <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16238897/avyfain.io/mog.pdf">his take</a> on the classic fight. Noah gives a good explanation for why they are, in a way, the same.
  - title: Carts Without Horses
    author: Aaron Harris
    url: http://www.aaronkharris.com/carts-without-horses
    note: Understanding that developing markets are fundamentally different beasts, and not just waiting for copies of what has already been done, is both challenging, and exciting. Makes me wonder what I could do if I went back home.
  - title: Why Trump voters are not “complete idiots”
    author: Chris Arnade
    source: Medium
    url: https://medium.com/@Chris_arnade/trump-politics-and-option-pricing-or-why-trump-voters-are-not-idiots-1e364a4ed940
    note: The expanded version of the <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_arnade/status/732000350991880192">tweetstorm</a>. Poor people understand optionality, too. If your downside is flat, and your upside isn’t, logic says break the system.
  - title: "What happened, what's happening now and what's next"
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/5/31/note-on-2016-what-happened-whats-happening-now-and-whats-next
    note: "Yes, two posts by Evans today. It's that good."
