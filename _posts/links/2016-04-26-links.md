  - title: Understanding the Rich Tapestry of American Culture as Experienced Through Food
    author: Mark Suster
    source: Both Sides of the Table
    url: https://bothsidesofthetable.com/understanding-the-rich-tapestry-of-american-culture-as-experienced-through-food-7488e7cb081
    note: "Last time Suster recommended a movie, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd0VOkPOrV0\">Supermensch</a>, I wasn't sold, but watched anyway. It was awesome, and now I want to watch this one too. VCs should do more movie/book/etc reviews. After all, a deep understanding of culture can give you an edge to make better bets than others. I am sure it has helped Upfront Ventures get where they are."
