  - title: The Increasing Problem With the Misinformed
    author: Thomas Baekdal
    url: https://www.baekdal.com/analysis/the-increasing-problem-with-the-misinformed
    note: "Extreme clarity on the future of journalism, media, and strategies for companies in the space to respond to change. TL;DR: create better content or disappear. The arguments fit perfectly with <a href='https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/'>Aggregation Theory</a>, and while the article is a bit too focused on politics, the analysis could apply to any other news covered by the media, from the Tech Bubble, to ISIS, or Millenials. Long, but worthwhile.</br>I have been reading Baekdal for years. I can't even remember how I ran into his blog, but it must have been 7 or 8 years ago, and I am glad I did."
  - title: Demystifying Venture Capital Economics (Part 4)
    author: Andy Rachleff
    source: Wealthfront
    url: https://blog.wealthfront.com/venture-capital-economics-part-4/
    note: "While I have read (...skimmed ðŸ™„) Mary Meeker's report several years in a row by now, I had never consciously noticed the acceleration of adoption rates of new technologies."
  - title: AdBlock Plus teams up with Flattr to help readers pay publishers
    author: Anthony Ha
    source: TechCrunch
    url: http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/adblock-plus-teams-up-with-flattr-to-help-readers-pay-publishers/
    note: Possibly more interesting than the opt-in model championed by Blendle.
  - title: Inevitability in technology
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/5/2/inevitability-in-technology
    note: Evans has a knack for finding great analogies from history. In most cases, path dependence, network effects, consumer lock in, and feedback loops matter more than any one decision. I wonder if we can systematically figure out the decisions that matter more...
  - title: My path to OpenAI
    author: Greg Brockman
    url: https://blog.gregbrockman.com/my-path-to-openai
    note: Somehow, the dots connect in the future.
  - title: Type Wars
    author: Robert C. Martin
    source: The Clean Code Blog
    url: http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/05/01/TypeWars.html
    note: Was not expecting Uncle Bob to finish on that note. The history of programming languages is a big question mark for me. If you have a good book/blog post to recommend on it, please send it my way.
  - title: Everything as a Service
    author: Ben Thompson
    source: Stratechery
    url: https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/
    note: Ben sounds more bullish in this article than in the past few, especially Exponent.
  - title: "Apple's Numbers"
    author: Bob Lefsetz
    url: http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/2016/04/27/apples-numbers/
    note: Yet another bear case for Apple pinned on the cult of personality for Steve Jobs. While I disagree with the overall message, the writing is really good, and Lefsetz does have a point on the strategy of innovation, viz. Christensen's disruptive innovation.
  - title: Obituaries My Mother Wrote for Me While I Was Living in San Francisco in My Twenties
    author: Bess Kalb
    source: The New Yorker
    url: http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/obituaries-my-mother-wrote-for-me-while-i-was-living-in-san-francisco-in-my-twenties
    note: The title says it all.
