  - title: For VCs, Your Thesis Is Your Portfolio Page, Everything Else is Just Hopes and Dreams
    author: Hunter Walk
    url: https://hunterwalk.com/2018/03/28/for-vcs-your-thesis-is-your-portfolio-page-everything-else-is-just-hopes-and-dreams/
    note: This is definitely targeted at someone, but I can't figure out who. Over the years I've realized that VCs, are not really gatekeepers, and they follow the same patterns of competition as everyone else. This post by Walk is an example of that dynamic. I like the idea of the VC portfolio page as a lagging indicator of what the VC wants to invest in.

  - title: How referendums break democracies
    author: Tim Harford
    url: http://timharford.com/2018/03/how-referendums-break-democracies/
    note: A thousand times yes. The average citizen knows nothing, is easily manipulated, and does not consider second and third order consequences. The 95 percentile citizen is not that different either. We outsource policy decisions and let politicians take care of things not because people are dumb, but because understanding the nuances of policy takes time and effort. Modern society believes in specialization and, by extension, if we let politicians be politicians while dentists take care of teeth and farmers take care of farms, everyone is better off.

  - title: Trade and the Cities (Wonkish)
    author: Paul Krugman
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/opinion/trade-and-the-cities-wonkish.html
    note: Krugman discusses how running a deficit vs. a surplus is about math and accounting and not about winning or losing, but just plain accounting. Then he goes on to compare international trade to inter-state trade. Inter-state and inter-city interactions are super interesting. I've always wondered why there isn't more research along these lines. Made me wonder whether there is a dataset that could be used to replicate the methodology of Dirk Brockmann's [research on mobility and effective communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLd1bOIx-Lo), but capturing trade instead of commerce.

  - title: We Need Mandatory Enduser APIs for Social and Search Systems
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: https://continuations.com/post/172413445510/we-need-mandatory-enduser-apis-for-social-and
    note: An extension of Albert's well known idea of bot representation. For most people "bot representation" is too abstract, but his rephrasing to “any system with 1 million+ users should by law be required to issue users with personal API keys” is quite clear. Brings up questions about the boundary of one user's data and the next user's data (ie, MY post on YOUR profile), what constitutes _enough_ APIs to meet said standard, and who gets to decide these terms. These systems do things on many layers, not all available via UI. They're different per user and change over time. The data that the API consumes and produces today looks different than it will tomorrow. The software engineering side would be a nightmare. But that can be solved with incentives. The more interesting question is whether we get access to the derived data, or just the raw. Am I only allowed access to my data points, or also the aggregates computed over time and in relation to other users? It'd be awesome to see something like this implemented.

  - title: The Death of the Newsfeed
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/4/2/the-death-of-the-newsfeed
    note: A discussion of how we consume information, and the cyclical nature of how we share things online. Evans' comparison of the number of items in your news feed to the number of invitees to a party is a clever analogy (kinda like Big O!) but the essay is fraught with uncharachteristically bad assumptions. Stories are less so about "units of content" than about market segmentation. Stories are a news feed, even if in a different format, and don't solve the oversharing problem - you still get N*M pieces of content.

    note: This problem has existed for ages. Technologists and scientists work on things because they are cool, and because they want to push science forward, regardless of the implications. The debate about whether technology is inherently good or not will keep going.

  - title: The many traditions of non-governmental money (part I)
    author: Nick Szabo
    source: Unenumerated
    url: https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2018/03/the-many-traditions-of-non-governmental.html
    note: "When people in 2018 think of money, they think of it much like we think of the nation state - this is how things work in the world, we are all citizens of some country, and that country issues its state-sponsored currency. Most people don't consider that history has followed different paths, and that we're not at the end of history. Within our lifetimes these institutions will probably shift shapes."

  - title: "It's time for an RSS revival"
    author: Brian Barrett
    source: Wired
    url: https://www.wired.com/story/rss-readers-feedly-inoreader-old-reader/
    note: I still use RSS daily. It aggregates the tiny blogs that produce content at a very slow rate, which I have no motive for visiting between posts, as well as socially ranked content from sites like Hacker News. The volume that I consume is relatively high, but the top of the funnel is limited on purpose, in ways that maybe it shouldn't be. Going back to Evans' post above, I think that having something with levers and knobs would be amazing, but I know I'm part of the fringe. The closest I've gotten is RSS.

  - title: Is Python interpreted or compiled? Yes.
    author: Ned Batchelder
    url: https://nedbatchelder.com//blog/201803/is_python_interpreted_or_compiled_yes.html
    note: This is one of those topics that confused me for a long time about Python. Ned's post is more of a description of the lay of the land than an explanation of how and why things work the way they do in Python, but it has inspired me to go and dig through those bytecode talks he linked to, and learn more about Python internals.

  - title: Everything I know about life I learned at Al's Deli
    author: Kate Bernot
    source: The Takeout
    url: https://thetakeout.com/everything-i-needed-to-know-in-life-i-learned-at-als-de-1823973097
    note: If you went to Northwestern, Al's was a staple. I walked in front of the shop daily, on my walk from home to school, and I probably had their sandwiches at least once a week while I lived in Evanston. This essay made me nostalgic about college life, and now I'm craving their croissant with baked ham and swiss.

  - title: Evolving Alien Corals

    note: An amazing procedural generation piece. The fact that it is both 3D, and animated, makes it all the more interesting.
