    note: "An oldie, but goodie. Someone should repeat this analysis and include 2015/2016 data. We've probably already crossed the 2x threshold."

    note: This reminded me of the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/05/465747726/-682-when-ceo-pay-exploded">Planet Money episode on CEO pay</a> and how hard it is to actually measure how employees are compensanted.

    note: I have been on the other side of the table of many interviews since I started working at Apple. It is unbelievably hard to gauge the skills of a front-end engineer, even more so when more than half the people involved in the interview process do back-end work day to day.
