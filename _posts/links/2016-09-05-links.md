  - title: "Labor Day: From the Job Loop to the Knowledge Loop"
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations

    note: What is the point of work? What should people spend their time on, and why? Wenger argues that we are about to enter a post-capital and post-labor world. I still haven't decided if I should read <a href= "http://worldaftercapital.org/">his book</a> now, as a draft, or when it is published in a few months.

    source: The New Yorker
    url: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/05/the-dream-of-enlightenment-by-anthony-gottlieb
    note: I should make an effort and learn more about history and philosophy. We are solving different immediate problems, but ultimately trying to answer the same basic questions as those that came before us.

    note: In a complex world, second order effects tend to be more important in aggregate than one would expect. Increased access to birth control results in better care for the kids who are born, and eventually a better society.

    note: Amazon is an impressively interesting company (as an aside, the old timey look of the photos is great, too). The original bits and atoms startup, which somehow keeps innovating.

  - title: All about Microservices
    source: a16z (Podcast)
    url: http://a16z.com/2016/09/01/microservices/
    note: Starting a career in software engineering during the days of AWS and Heroku gives me a strange vantage point. The story of how Netflix switched their whole infrastructure would not be half as impressive if I didn't understand the role of culture in organizational change. The fact is that "this is how we do things around here" can make or break you. This episode talks about the architecture that underlie the modern web stack.
