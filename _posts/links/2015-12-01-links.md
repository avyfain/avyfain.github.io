I have been listening to [Startup](https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/) the past couple of days, so I have not been reading that much lately. It provides a view of the tech and startup world from an outsider's perspective, and when discussing concepts that I take as general knowledge it constantly makes me think "Wait, most people don't know that?" 

If you have not listened to it, you should.
