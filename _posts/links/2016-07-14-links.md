    note: 'Living in San Francisco, and having just attended <a href="http://faingezicht.com/photos/2016/06/27/pride/">Pride</a>, this seemed very fitting. A really interesting story, which made me think a lot about how what is socially and culturally acceptable changes over time and space.'

    note: "I listened to this several weeks ago, but just noticed I hadn't posted it. Mostly recommending it for Act 1, which deals with a really hard story. Especially interesting due to the herd mentality of \"we do this because it is the way we've always done it,\" which I hate so much. Other people's decisions can change our lives forever. Sometimes unknowingly, and for all the wrong reasons."

As you can tell from the articles below, I've read a lot about consciousness lately. In general, I like the topic a lot, but I was actually trying to find an article on the subject from a couple of years ago that I remember being really good. Sadly, I didn't find it, but it did take me down the rabbit hole of the Internet, and I found all of the consciousness related posts below, so hopefully you will enjoy those.
