  - title: The Lottery (1948)
    author: Shirley Jackson
    source: The New Yorker
    url: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1948/06/26/the-lottery
    note: "This is a short story about mob mentality and the value (and harm) of tradition. The last few years I've been grappling more and more with the tension between tradition and change. The kernel of conservatism expressed by [Chesterton's fence](https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/) seems extremely valid: \"Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place.\" At the same time, if we never removed fences whose purpose we don't truly understand, we'd live in a much worse world. Apparently, after the @newyorker published this story, they got back more letters than from any other work of fiction they had ever published."
 - title: Truth, utility & education (2020)
   author: Chris Dillow
   source: Stumbling and Mumbling
   url: https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2020/08/truth-utility-education.html
   note: On education, and the conflict between teaching people things that are true, or things that are useful. It reminded me in some ways of Donald Hoffman's [case against reality](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/04/the-illusion-of-reality/479559/), and the idea that our brains learn a representation of the world that best allows us navigate the world and live in it, instead of optimizing for accuracy.
 - title: Regulating technology (2020)
   author: Benedict Evans
   url: https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/7/23/regulating-technology
   note: What does it even mean to regulate "technology," when everything is permeated by it? On the contracting timelines of innovation, the complexity of an evolving (and mostly borderless) industry, and the political mechanisms of regulation trying to play catch up.
 - title: When big tech buys small tech (2021)
   author: Benedict Evans
   url: https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/11/12/when-big-tech-buys-small-tech
   note: Most acquisitions are noise. If the problem is specific acquisitions, then how do you know ex-ante which ones will matter? If it's all of them, then how do you incentivize entrepreneurs to start companies while blocking exits? It's very easy to look at acquisitions after the fact and connect the dots, but creating a coherent set of rules or ideas to define which deals can and can't go through seems nearly impossible. As usual, it'd turn into a game of picking favorites.
 - title: The Four Quadrants of Conformism (2020)
   author: Paul Graham
   url: http://paulgraham.com/conformism.html
   note: "A simple 2x2 of conventional/independent-minded and passive/aggressive at the other axis. Not surprisingly, Graham has some strong thoughts: \"...it seems to me that aggressively conventional-minded people are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the trouble in the world.\" Also not surprisingly, I happen to agree."
 - title: China’s Artificial Intelligence Surveillance State Goes Global (2020)
   author: Ross Andersen
   source: The Atlantic
   url: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china-ai-surveillance/614197/
   note: This article was scary enough in 2020 when it came out. With a couple of years of hindsight, and having seen a lot of the news coming out of China during the pandemic I'm even more upset about China's central role in our geopolitical future.
 - title: You should include your tests in coverage (2020)
   author: Ned Batchelder
   url: https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202008/you_should_include_your_tests_in_coverage.html
   note: "A short and sweet technical post. The title says it all, but Ned explicitly calls out his reasoning, too: \"tests are real code. Coverage measurement can tell you useful things about that code.\""
  - title: New Climate Maps Show a Transformed United States (2020)
    author:  Al Shaw, Abrahm Lustgarten, and Jeremy W. Goldsmith,
    source: ProPublica
    url: https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/
    note: An awesome, albeit scary, set of visualizations of how climate change might affect different parts of the US and force people to move around in the next few decades.
 - title: Why ‘Civilization’ is a political masterpiece (2020)
   author: Sam Leith
   source: UnHerd
   url: https://unherd.com/2020/09/why-civilization-is-a-political-masterpiece/
   note: I spent a good chunk of the found time of early pandemic days playing Civilization. This is a nice homage to the series, and why so many people have fallen in love with Sid Meier’s classic.
 - title:  Coordination, Good and Bad (2020)
   author: Vitalik Buterin
   url: https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html
   note: "A short essay on the benefits of decentralization as ways to avoid collusion that leads to worse societal outcomes and the mechanisms that can enable it. As Vitalik clearly states \"[...] markets can only solve some problems; in particular, they cannot tell us what variables we should be optimizing for in the first place,\" but markets enable those core values to emerge from the actions that each of us takes. When markets don't get us to what society at large \"believes\" to be the better outcome, it's often because people's stated beliefs don't actually agree with their selfish goals, as revealed by their actions."
 - title: Do I Deserve What I Have? Part III (2020)
   author: Russ Roberts
   url: https://russroberts.medium.com/do-i-deserve-what-i-have-part-iii-52b2f1622a5
   note: On taxation, redistribution, and why our governments can't solve problems like poverty or homelessness. Don't miss out on parts [I](https://medium.com/@russroberts/do-i-deserve-what-i-have-part-i-6553091dd85c?source=friends_link&sk=733c74a2e3134594ea73a3516f1de4ea) and [II](https://medium.com/@russroberts/do-i-deserve-what-i-have-part-ii-9ee3ce75b46e)
  - title: Debt is Coming (2020)
    author: Alex Danco
    url: https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/
    note: "I've always found it interesting that startups run on equity instead of debt. Here, Danco lays out a good argument for why this is the case, and why he thought the model was about to flip on its head. He cites Carlota Perez's _Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital_ and argues that the relationship between production capital and financial capital (PK/FK) is well understood, and that we're near the turning point where these two recouple. The pandemic got in the way, and the debt market still hasn't matured in the direction he predicted, but it's a reasonable theory nontheless. We'll see whether we end up getting there.

    This is a super complex topic, and I'd really love to learn more about debt financing. I've found a few good resources [here](https://medium.com/startup-grind/a-founders-guideline-to-debt-financing-14e99e9d58b6), [here](https://a16z.com/2022/04/15/16-things-to-know-about-raising-debt-for-startups/), and [here](https://www.vouch.us/on-the-line/equity-versus-debt-financing)."
 - title: Why are we so bad at software engineering?
   author: Jacob Voytko
   url: https://www.bitlog.com/2020/02/12/why-are-we-so-bad-at-software-engineering/
   note: A short essay discussing the economics of code quality, project management, and how amazing it is that we can ship any code that works.
 - title: Andreessen-Horowitz craps on "AI" startups from a great height (2020)
   author: Scott Locklin
   url: https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/02/21/andreessen-horowitz-craps-on-ai-startups-from-a-great-height/
   note: In which the author dissects [Martin Casado's and Matt Bornstein's blog post on ML businesses](https://future.com/new-business-ai-different-traditional-software/). I have thought hard about this, and I mostly agree that the moat is not the model, but the data. If you have novel datasets, you can do a lot of things that your competitors won't be able to, and that flywheel spins fast.
 - title: To Get Good, Go After The Metagame (2020)
   author: Cedric Chin
   source: Commoncog
   url: https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/
   note: Merely being good at something is not enough. You have to understand how a field has evolved in order to know where it's going.
 - title: Why Life Is Pretty Good But Doesn’t Feel So Great (2020)
   author: Noah Smith
   source: Bloomberg
   url: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-02/why-life-is-pretty-good-but-doesn-t-feel-so-great
   note: The average USian lives a much better life than they did in the 50s, but our expectations of what a good life is have also shifted since then.
 - title: "Bank Runs and Panics: A Primer (2020)"
   author: Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit Schoenholtz
   source: Money and Banking
   url: https://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2020/3/1/bank-runs-and-panics-a-primer
   note: For me, the most fascinating topic in economics has always been the non linearity of panics. This is a good starting point, without any math.
 - title: Coronavirus Might Make Americans Miss Big Government (2020)
   author: Noah Smith
   source: Bloomberg
   url: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-04/coronavirus-might-make-americans-miss-big-government
   note: It's pretty sad to read this two years later and seeing that the "state capacity" narrative was exactly right.

 - title: The Art of Choosing What to Do With Your Life
   author: Benjamin Storey and Jenna Silber Storey
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/15/opinion/college-students-happiness-liberal-arts.html
   note: 

 - title: Tech’s Offshore Hiring Has Gone Into Overdrive
   author: Arielle Pardes, Vittoria Elliott
   source: Wired
   url: https://www.wired.com/story/techs-offshore-hiring-has-gone-into-overdrive/
   note: In terms of output, there's no difference for a Silicon Valley startup between hiring an engineer in a small Midwestern town and a similarly skilled engineer in Latin America. There's talent everywhere. Super cool to see Telescoped featured in Wired!
 - title: Failure to Cope "Under Capitalism" 
   author: Clare Coffey
   source: Gawker
   url: https://www.gawker.com/culture/failure-to-cope-under-capitalism
   note: "\"considering the shape of your life & then living it with vigor is so difficult because it cannot be externally validated … there’s no one who can tell you that you did it right. But this is not the condition of life under capitalism, this is life itself\""
 - title: Airflow's Problem
   author: Stephen Bailey
   url: https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/airflows-problem
   note: "The job of today’s data engineers is more akin to managing the entire transportation network [...] When the growth team drops 1000 scooters on the streets overnight, data engineers have to ensure they don’t cause accidents or get people killed."
 - title: Notable People
   author: Topi Tjukanov
   url: https://tjukanovt.github.io/notable-people
   note: An extremely cool data viz - a map with the most notable people in every city around the world.

   source: Santa Fe Institute
   url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHpg-CriIyk&list=PL7D69D1FFE63DA81A&index=10&t=340s
   note: "A really interesting talk. The main takeaway is that there's tacit knowledge embedded in our brains, and in our social networks. ccess to this implicit knowhow is what drives inequality between places and societies."

 - title: Immigration Then and Now
   author: Russ Roberts, Ran Abramitzky, and Leah Boustan
   source: EconTalk
   url: https://www.econtalk.org/ran-abramitzky-and-leah-boustan-on-immigration-then-and-now/
   note: I already had Abramitzky and Boustan's new book on the to-read pile, but having heard some of the methodology behind their research in this conversation I am even more excited to dig in. Fascinating use of novel data + ML!
 - title: Opening a Restaurant in Boston Takes 92 Steps, 22 Forms, 17 Office Visits, and $5,554 in 12 Fees. Why?
   author: Victor W. Hwang
   source: Inc.
   url: https://www.inc.com/victor-w-hwang/institute-of-justice-regulations.html
   note: "How much protection does the public need from a bookstore? What would be the public harm if there were too many? [...] Opening a restaurant in San Francisco requires that 17 government fees be paid at a total cost of $22,648."
 - title: NFT ‘Service Token’ Airdropped to Alleged Crypto Thief’s Wallet Satisfies Due Process Notice Requirement says NY Supreme Court
   author: Jerry Gianakis
   source: Twitter
   url: https://twitter.com/JerryGianakis/status/1536423045140725760
   note: nteresting development. The key piece that doesn’t make sense to me is… how does the court freeze the assets? All I can think of is something like a mandated blocklist at a choke point like ConsenSys or Coinbase?
 - title: There Has to Be a Better Way to Run the Government
   author: Ezra Klein
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/12/opinion/traffic-congestion-new-york-climate-policy.html
   note: There are costs to building the wrong things or executing the wrong projects. There might be even higher costs from stasis.

   author: Jerusalem Demsas
   source: The Atlantic
   url: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/population-growth-housing-climate-change/629952/
   note: Spot on. It's always been an "us vs them" problem of who gets to benefit and who doesn't.
 - title: The Math Prodigy Whose Hack Upended DeFi Won’t Give Back His Millions
   author: Christopher Beam

   author: Manny Garcia
   source: Zillow Research
   url: https://www.zillow.com/research/modest-densification-zhar-30934/
   note: 73% of homeowners in the US support "modest densification” via ADUs/duplexes/triplexes in residential areas. Support is even higher among renters (84%). This is true across many cities. Why doesn't this translate into policy?

   author: John Moe
   source: McSweeney's
   url: https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-your-favorite-sad-dad-band-says-about-you
   note: Just a cool horoscope. The National is probably my favorite of the list. Definitely at the boundary, fwiw. I was never great at soccer and have no plans to live in Brooklyn, though.

 - title: "Instagram Captures A Million Users. Up Next: API, Android, And Funding (2010)"
   author: M.G. Siegler
   source: Techcrunch
   url: https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/21/instagram-one-million/
   note: Earlier this year people were talking about the number of users of Opensea surpassing 1M. Lots of money moving around, and lots of us are paying attention, but only 1M users have actually transacted in NFTs on the most developed open platform available… there’s a long way to go. Back in 2010, this article discussed the time to 1M users for some Web 2.0 social networks. Foursquare 1 year, Twitter 2, and Instagram 0.25, or three months. Obviously the base has grown significantly since then, but it doesn't seem like web3's growth stuck around.
 - title: 1,760 Acres. That’s How Much More of Manhattan We Need.
   author:  Jason M. Barr
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/opinion/eric-adams-manhattan-expand.html
   note: Quite the proposal. I want some of whatever Barr is on. Unfortunately in 2022 there’s about 0% chance that a proposal like this would be taken seriously, even though it’d solve a lot of long term problems. Who’s got the political will to take the long term, anyway?
 - title: The New Normal
   author: Schema Design, Google Trends, and Axios. Art direction by Alberto Cairo.
   url: https://thenewnormal.is/
   note: "How the Covid-19 pandemic is shaping our shopping searches. Some obvious ones: masks, paper products, yeast, rice and beans, jigsaw puzzles, etc. Delayed reaction is interesting on desks and office chairs, too. Some I just don't get... what happened with mattresses?"
 - title: Should some countries cease to exist?
   author: Branko Milanovic
   url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/should-some-countries-cease-to-exist
   note: I've asked myself this question before in the context of small towns in the US. There, the problem is not a barrier to emigration, but towns whose existence is subsidized by market distortions. The post  discusses constraints to free international movement. In the US, people can move anywhere, but I'd posit more people stay in suburbs/rural areas because of subsidies to gasoline/highways crisscrossing the country than they would without those distortions. There might be something to learn here from aging Japanese villages or Russian ghost towns?
 - title: Web3-based Buildings (2021)

   author: Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit Schoenholtz
   source: Money and Banking
   url: https://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2021/12/13/stablecoin-the-regulation-debate
   note: "On a combined basis, Tether dominates stablecoin trading volume: its Q2 daily average ($127.3 billion) exceeds the latest 10-day moving average of trading on the NYSE ($71 billion) and approaches the volume on NASDAQ ($148 billion)." Too big to ignore, but almost a year after this was written and a couple of crashes later there's still no regulation

   note: "In city after city, the mass-market, working-class housing of its time has acquired a distinctly bourgeois reputation today. In all cases, the reason lies in economics, not design [...] what's scarce becomes culturally coded as elite."

   author: Bryan Offutt
   source: Locally Optimistic
   url: https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/the-next-big-challenge-for-data-is-organizational/
   note: "\"... without solving the ownership problem, the question of 'who is responsible for this' is still a shrug at scale.\"

    Data problems, like all others in engineering, are about people not communicating the right info at the right time."
   - title: Eating the Cloud from Outside In
     author: swyx
     url: https://www.swyx.io/cloudflare-go/
     note: I don't know enough chess nor go to fully enjoy these analogies, but there's something intriguing in the broader strategy at play here. I'm certainly happier that Cloudflare's competition is pushing AWS prices down!
 - title: Ricardo, Marx, and interpersonal inequality
   author: Branko Milanovic
   url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/ricardo-marx-and-interpersonal-inequality
   note: "...that people could have both labor and property incomes (even if the rich still depend mostly on property incomes), is not envisaged by either Ricardo or Marx"

    I'd expect to see more theory here, who's writing it?

   author: Robert Mundell
   source: The American Economic Review
   url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/money2%2Freadings%2FMundell.pdf

   note: I’m still planning to finish reading Capital, and have Smith’s books on my to-read list, too.

    What books we should expect our politicians to read, if any? Which ones would help them be better at their jobs?

   note: "Imagine if, in middle age, I felt entitled to pass laws so I could keep doing that into my 70s and 80s, no matter how many kids never got a turn. That is the anti-growth Californian, mistaking nostalgia for justice."

 - title: On Conflicted (Podcast)
   author: Ian Leslie and Russ Roberts
   source: EconTalk
   url: https://www.econtalk.org/ian-leslie-on-conflicted/
   note: Globalization, specialization, and the internet all drive us to interactions in which we have to do extra work to talk to each other in the same terms. Increasingly, we live in a [low context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) world.

   author: Will Wilkinson

   note: Wilkinson on Mundell. Many problems are tied to how we delimit which rules apply to which people, but those boundaries are not just international borders.
 - title: The overconsumption theory of bitcoin (and decentralization in general) (2021)
   author: J.P. Koning
   source: Moneyness
   url: https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-overconsumption-theory-of-bitcoin.html
   note: "...why not fix the mistake of overconsumption by levying a yearly tax on the value of cryptocurrency holdings? Like a carbon tax, it would force mainstream users to internalize the costs of consuming decentralization." The over-consumption of decentralization angle could also be an argument for side-chains, which are less decentralized that the full-on blockchain of BTC or ETH, but more decentralized than ExcelCoin.

   author: Kevin Roose
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/technology/welcome-to-the-yolo-economy.html
   note: This resonated a lot. Anecdotally, a few friends decided to move from SF to Europe, many are about to leave cushy jobs for side projects, others (like me) are leaving big tech for startups, and some are leaving startups just to travel. Odd times ahead.

   note: "I've made this argument for years now:

The US Dollar has a privileged position in the international finance, and is key to the US's hegemonic power. It should not be taken for granted, especially when other nations are explicitly trying to undermine it."

   source: Overcoming Bias
   url: https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/03/sell-tax-rights-to-make-agents.html
   note: An interesting idea regarding reallocating revenue streams. It seems like a modern version of "tax-farming," but I don't have any critiques at first blush.

   author: Alex Danco
   url: https://alexdanco.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-cbgbs-hows-that-for-a-clickbait-title/
   note: The fact that ideas are not owned by any one person and that they’re not priced makes it hard for us to think of them as capital, but a large portion of capital creation comes from intangibles becoming part of the zeitgeist.

 - title: Why did I leave Google or, why did I stay so long? (2021)
   author: Noam Bardin
   url: https://paygo.ghost.io/why-did-i-leave-google-or-why-did-i-stay-so-long/
   note: "You need to be able to answer the \"what have I done for our users today\" question with \"not much but I got promoted\" and be happy with that answer to be successful in Corp-Tech. I guess that's just not me.

   The [followup](https://marker.medium.com/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-startup-within-a-big-company-c3003615f3bc) from Hunter Walk on \"Why There’s No Such Thing as a ‘Startup Within a Big Company’\" was also great."

   author: Sabrina Imbler
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/science/black-footed-ferret-clone.html
   note: This Revive & Restore project is fascinating. It is widely considered to be "a bad thing" when humans mess with the environment enough that we destroy a species and make it go extinct. Is it also bad when we mess enough with it to bring one back, too? Raises interesting questions on how we think of balancing between what is natural and what is man-made. When we intervene to counterbalance previous humans' actions, how far can we go before we're intervening ourselves?

   source: City Journal
   url: https://www.city-journal.org/journalism-advocacy-over-reporting
   note: This piece by highlights the new equilibrium brought about by the financial incentives of journalism on the internet. Let's get rid of nuance. Whose absolute truth do you believe in? It pairs nicely with [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/business/media/new-york-times-donald-mcneil.html) from Ben Smith, which highlights the same generational divide.

   author: Eleanor Lutz
   url: https://tabletopwhale.com/2019/06/24/a-geologic-map-of-mars.html
   note: It's strange how used we are to looking at the Earth's map, and the conventional colors of green/blue to represent land and sea. I don't even know where to begin here!

   author:  Kevin Vallier
   source: Niskanen Center
   url: https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-why-and-how-of-reasonable-disagreement/
   note: The idea that “reasonable people can disagree, and that’s ok” was key to Rawls’ philosophy. It's a core tenet of real liberalism.

   author: John Gruber
   source: Daring Fireball
   url: https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/facebook_free_as_in_bullshit
   note: This cultural difference between FB and Apple (which, yes, conveniently aligns with just one of the companies' business models) is one of the things that kept me working at Apple. Privacy matters. I'm glad someone's standing up for it.

 - title: "Tech" in SF vs in the Valley
   author: Sean Byrnes
   source: Twitter
   url: https://twitter.com/sbyrnes/status/1339631388773941249
   note: History matters. Tech's prominence in SF is new. Sean's thread is 👌 The center of gravity shifted in the last 10 years. Some of it due to policy, some due to tech itself changing (AWS, anyone?) and some, because people's priorities change (see Richard Florida's creative class). FWIW, the narrative about the SF vs SV divide isn't new. [This](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html?hp&_r=0) was in the NYT back in 2014, before I came to SF.

 - title: How America Invests (2020)
   source: Vanguard
   url: https://archive.ph/Yb2Fc
   note: Vanguard released a fascinating report on how their customers invested over the last 5 years. The average Vanguard customer has 20%+ in cash. 20% of their customers hold no equities (!) and the median portfolio is a household of 1 holding ~$60k.

 - title: Industrial literacy (2020)
   author: Jason Crawford
   source: Roots of Progress
   url: https://rootsofprogress.org/industrial-literacy
   note: Our modern society is built on top of what, for most people, are invisible building blocks. When technology works so well that average Joe doesn’t even think about it, it’s easy to take that technology for granted.
 - title: Neurath's Boat
   source: Wikipedia
   url: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat
   note: "I love this idea, thinking of society as a boat being rebuilt at open sea, which I first heard from Martin Hägglund: \"Who I can be—how my boat is built—depends on socially shared norms, which I am bound to uphold, challenge, or transform through what I do.\""
 - title: Consider the interface (2020)
   author: Alvaro Videla
   source: The Increment
   url: https://increment.com/apis/consider-the-interface-api-redesign/
   note: Often, we write code to scratch our itches, not knowing that our code will be turned on its head as the building block for someone else’s solution to a problem we didn’t know existed. Good design is about foreseeing those situations.
 - title: While Statues Sleep (2019)
   author: Thomas Laqueur
   source: London Review of Books
   url: https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n12/thomas-laqueur/while-statues-sleep
   note: We can draw analogies, parallels even, but saying that the modern United States is "as bad" as Nazi Germany is merely absurd. The two regimes are qualitatively different. Time scales matter. Intensity matter. What's valued, at least on paper, matters.
 - title: Capitalism, Alone (Podcast, 2020)
   author: Branko Milanovic, Russ Roberts
   source: EconTalk
   url: https://www.econtalk.org/branko-milanovic-on-capitalism-alone/
   note: Modern society, in part because of secularism, no longer has an objective morality to point to, so instead we point to the law, not even questioning that it could be flawed.
