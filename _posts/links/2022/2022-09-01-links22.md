   author: Arielle Pardes, Vittoria Elliott
   source: Wired
   url: https://www.wired.com/story/techs-offshore-hiring-has-gone-into-overdrive/
   note: In terms of output, there's no difference for a Silicon Valley startup between hiring an engineer in a small Midwestern town and a similarly skilled engineer in Latin America. There's talent everywhere. Super cool to see Telescoped featured in Wired!

 - title: Airflow's Problem
   author: Stephen Bailey
   url: https://stkbailey.substack.com/p/airflows-problem
   note: "The job of today‚Äôs data engineers is more akin to managing the entire transportation network [...] When the growth team drops 1000 scooters on the streets overnight, data engineers have to ensure they don‚Äôt cause accidents or get people killed."
 - title: Notable People

   url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHpg-CriIyk&list=PL7D69D1FFE63DA81A&index=10&t=340s
   note: "A really interesting talk. The main takeaway is that there's tacit knowledge embedded in our brains, and in our social networks. ccess to this implicit knowhow is what drives inequality between places and societies."
 - title: Immigration Then and Now (Podcast)
   author: Russ Roberts, Ran Abramitzky, and Leah Boustan
   source: EconTalk
   url: https://www.econtalk.org/ran-abramitzky-and-leah-boustan-on-immigration-then-and-now/
   note: I already had Abramitzky and Boustan's new book on the to-read pile, but having heard some of the methodology behind their research in this conversation I am even more excited to dig in. Fascinating use of novel data + ML!
 - title: Opening a Restaurant in Boston Takes 92 Steps, 22 Forms, 17 Office Visits, and $5,554 in 12 Fees. Why?
   author: Victor W. Hwang
   source: Inc.
   url: https://www.inc.com/victor-w-hwang/institute-of-justice-regulations.html
   note: "How much protection does the public need from a bookstore? What would be the public harm if there were too many? [...] Opening a restaurant in San Francisco requires that 17 government fees be paid at a total cost of $22,648."

   author: Jerry Gianakis
   source: Twitter
   url: https://twitter.com/JerryGianakis/status/1536423045140725760
   note: nteresting development. The key piece that doesn‚Äôt make sense to me is‚Ä¶ how does the court freeze the assets? All I can think of is something like a mandated blocklist at a choke point like ConsenSys or Coinbase?
 - title: There Has to Be a Better Way to Run the Government
   author: Ezra Klein
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/12/opinion/traffic-congestion-new-york-climate-policy.html

   url: https://archive.ph/xL6vb

   note: 73% of homeowners in the US support "modest densification‚Äù via ADUs/duplexes/triplexes in residential areas. Support is even higher among renters (84%). This is true across many cities. Why doesn't this translate into policy?

   author: Joshua Keating
   source: Grid
   url: https://www.grid.news/story/global/2022/02/22/luhansk-donetsk-why-two-peoples-republics-may-be-a-trip-wire-for-a-ukraine-war/
   note: Probably the most articulate summary I read about the explosion of the war in Ukraine earlier this year.

   author: David Rosenthal
   source: Stanford Seminar
   url: https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/ee380-talk.html

   author: Alan Lightman
   source: Our Artful Cosmos
   url: https://ourartfulcosmos.com/chance-and-accident/
   note: "On randomness: \"...each one of us is 1 out of 300 billion human beings that could have been created by our parents. None of those other 299,999,999,999 human beings exist. But they might have.\""
 - title: Free trade and war

   url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/free-trade-and-war

   author: John Moe
   source: McSweeney's
   url: https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/what-your-favorite-sad-dad-band-says-about-you
   note: Just a cool horoscope. The National is probably my favorite of the list. Definitely at the boundary, fwiw. I was never great at soccer and have no plans to live in Brooklyn, though.

 - title: "Instagram Captures A Million Users. Up Next: API, Android, And Funding (2010)"
   author: M.G. Siegler
   source: Techcrunch
   url: https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/21/instagram-one-million/
   note: Earlier this year people were talking about the number of users of Opensea surpassing 1M. Lots of money moving around, and lots of us are paying attention, but only 1M users have actually transacted in NFTs on the most developed open platform available‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a long way to go. Back in 2010, this article discussed the time to 1M users for some Web 2.0 social networks. Foursquare 1 year, Twitter 2, and Instagram 0.25, or three months. Obviously the base has grown significantly since then, but it doesn't seem like web3's growth stuck around.
 - title: 1,760 Acres. That‚Äôs How Much More of Manhattan We Need.
   author:  Jason M. Barr
   source: New York Times
   url: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/14/opinion/eric-adams-manhattan-expand.html
   note: Quite the proposal. I want some of whatever Barr is on. Unfortunately in 2022 there‚Äôs about 0% chance that a proposal like this would be taken seriously, even though it‚Äôd solve a lot of long term problems. Who‚Äôs got the political will to take the long term, anyway?
 - title: The New Normal
   author: Schema Design, Google Trends, and Axios. Art direction by Alberto Cairo.
   url: https://thenewnormal.is/
   note: "How the Covid-19 pandemic is shaping our shopping searches. Some obvious ones: masks, paper products, yeast, rice and beans, jigsaw puzzles, etc. Delayed reaction is interesting on desks and office chairs, too. Some I just don't get... what happened with mattresses?"
 - title: Should some countries cease to exist?
   author: Branko Milanovic
   url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/should-some-countries-cease-to-exist
   note: I've asked myself this question before in the context of small towns in the US. There, the problem is not a barrier to emigration, but towns whose existence is subsidized by market distortions. The post  discusses constraints to free international movement. In the US, people can move anywhere, but I'd posit more people stay in suburbs/rural areas because of subsidies to gasoline/highways crisscrossing the country than they would without those distortions. There might be something to learn here from aging Japanese villages or Russian ghost towns?
