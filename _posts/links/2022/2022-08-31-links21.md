  - title: When big tech buys small tech (2021)
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2021/11/12/when-big-tech-buys-small-tech
    note: Most acquisitions are noise. If the problem is specific acquisitions, then how do you know ex-ante which ones will matter? If it's all of them, then how do you incentivize entrepreneurs to start companies while blocking exits? It's very easy to look at acquisitions after the fact and connect the dots, but creating a coherent set of rules or ideas to define which deals can and can't go through seems nearly impossible. As usual, it'd turn into a game of picking favorites.

    author: Liz Voeller

    url: https://www.moneyandbanking.com/commentary/2021/12/13/stablecoin-the-regulation-debate
    note: "\"On a combined basis, Tether dominates stablecoin trading volume: its Q2 daily average ($127.3 billion) exceeds the latest 10-day moving average of trading on the NYSE ($71 billion) and approaches the volume on NASDAQ ($148 billion).\"\n\nToo big to ignore, but almost a year after this was written and a couple of crashes later there's still no regulation"

    author: Tim Babb
    url: https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/
    note: You know how when you're walking around a big city your GPS is all over the place, but somehow you can still get where you want to go? Here's the math behind that.

    url: https://avc.com/2021/12/the-great-formation/
    note: “…people are going to work for themselves and/or going into small businesses that are not part of the employer survey. Maybe what we are witnessing is not the Great Resignation but the Great Formation.”

    author: Sebastian Bensusan
    source: Twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/sebasbensu/status/1463936000896475138

  - title: The dangers of stablecoin lending (2021)
    author: J.P. Koning
    source: Moneyness
    url: https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/11/the-dangers-of-stablecoin-lending.html
    note: It's pretty amazing how most people don't realize that deposits in a savings account make them creditors to their banks.

    author: Daniel Herriges
    source: Strong Towns
    url: https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/11/3/our-self-imposed-scarcity-of-nice-places
    note: "In city after city, the mass-market, working-class housing of its time has acquired a distinctly bourgeois reputation today. In all cases, the reason lies in economics, not design [...] what's scarce becomes culturally coded as elite."
  - title: The Next Big Challenge for Data is Organizational (2021)
    author: Bryan Offutt
    source: Locally Optimistic
    url: https://locallyoptimistic.com/post/the-next-big-challenge-for-data-is-organizational/
    note: "\"... without solving the ownership problem, the question of 'who is responsible for this' is still a shrug at scale.\"\n\nData problems, like all others in engineering, are about people not communicating the right info at the right time."
  - title: Eating the Cloud from Outside In (2021)
    author: swyx
    url: https://www.swyx.io/cloudflare-go/
    note: "I don't know enough chess nor go to fully enjoy these analogies, but there's something intriguing in the broader strategy at play here. I'm certainly happier that Cloudflare's competition is pushing AWS prices down!"
  - title: Ricardo, Marx, and interpersonal inequality (2021)
    author: Branko Milanovic
    url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/ricardo-marx-and-interpersonal-inequality
    note: "\"...that people could have both labor and property incomes (even if the rich still depend mostly on property incomes), is not envisaged by either Ricardo or Marx\"\n\nI'd expect to see more theory here, who's writing it?"
  - title: On Medici and Thiel (2021)
    source: Strange Loop Canon
    url: https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/on-medici-and-thiel?triedSigningIn=true
    note: On how we lack true patronage in the modern world. While it’s somewhat meandering I find it quite compelling.
  - title: Why were the Balkans underdeveloped? A geographical hypothesis (2021)
    author: Branko Milanovic
    url: https://branko2f7.substack.com/p/why-were-the-balkans-underdeveloped
    note: Is geography destiny?
  - title: A Guide to Finding Faith (2021)
    author: Ross Douthat
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/opinion/sunday/faith-religion.html
    note: an interesting read, but I'm not sure if it said anything, or if it was just a few thousand words of waving his hands.
  - title: A Reconsideration of the Twentieth Century (1999)
    author: Robert Mundell
    source: The American Economic Review
    url: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/money2%2Freadings%2FMundell.pdf
    note: Mundell's Nobel Prize speech from 1999 is hilariously optimistic, looking through the tinted glasses of American exceptionalism.
  - title: Local Theater Reopens after 434 Days Closed
    source: Stillwater Films
    url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuLPpTfm5b0
    note: A short documentary about The Roxie movie theater reopening in San Francisco after being closed for over a year due to COVID.

    note: "I’m still planning to finish reading Capital, and have Smith’s books on my to-read list, too.\n\nWhat books we should expect our politicians to read, if any? Which ones would help them be better at their jobs?"
  - title: Reflections as the Internet Archive turns 25 (2021)
    author: Brewster Kahle
    source: Internet Archive
    url: https://blog.archive.org/2021/07/21/reflections-as-the-internet-archive-turns-25/
    note: “At the end of the day, the Internet and the World Wide Web–it’s just us. It’s just a history of humankind. And it has been an experiment in sharing and openness.”

    author: Conor Friedersdorf
    source: The Atlantic
    url: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/california-dream-dying/619509/
    note: "Imagine if, in middle age, I felt entitled to pass laws so I could keep doing that into my 70s and 80s, no matter how many kids never got a turn. That is the anti-growth Californian, mistaking nostalgia for justice."
  - title: Conflicted (Podcast, 2021)
    author: Ian Leslie and Russ Roberts
    source: EconTalk
    url: https://www.econtalk.org/ian-leslie-on-conflicted/
    note: Globalization, specialization, and the internet all drive us to interactions in which we have to do extra work to talk to each other in the same terms. Increasingly, we live in a [low context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) world.
  - title: America Isn't an "Optimum Currency Area" (2021)
    author: Will Wilkinson
    url: https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/america-isnt-an-optimum-currency
    note: Wilkinson on Mundell. Many problems are tied to how we delimit which rules apply to which people, but those boundaries are not just international borders.
  - title: The overconsumption theory of bitcoin (and decentralization in general) (2021)
    author: J.P. Koning
    source: Moneyness
    url: https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-overconsumption-theory-of-bitcoin.html
    note: "\"...why not fix the mistake of overconsumption by levying a yearly tax on the value of cryptocurrency holdings? Like a carbon tax, it would force mainstream users to internalize the costs of consuming decentralization.\" The over-consumption of decentralization angle could also be an argument for side-chains, which are less decentralized that the full-on blockchain of BTC or ETH, but more decentralized than ExcelCoin."
  - title: A Cyclist on the English Landscape (2021)
    author: Roff Smith
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/travel/sussex-bicycle-portraits.html

    author: Annalee Newitz
    source: Washington Post
    url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/01/civilization-collapse-rome-angkor-harappa/
    note: I read this right after reading the bits of Cixin Liu's Death's End that cover the Earth Civilization Museum, which made for a good perspective.
  - title: Welcome to the YOLO Economy (2021)
    author: Kevin Roose
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/technology/welcome-to-the-yolo-economy.html
    note: This resonated a lot. Anecdotally, a few friends decided to move from SF to Europe, many are about to leave cushy jobs for side projects, others (like me) are leaving big tech for startups, and some are leaving startups just to travel. Odd times ahead.
  - title: Don’t Let China Mint the Money of the Future (2021)
    author: Niall Ferguson
    source: Bloomberg
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-04/don-t-let-china-mint-the-digital-currency-of-the-future
    note: "I've made this argument for years now:\n\nThe US Dollar has a privileged position in the international finance, and is key to the US's hegemonic power. It should not be taken for granted, especially when other nations are explicitly trying to undermine it."
  - title: Berkson's Paradox
    author: Adam Strandberg, Christopher Williams, Ken Jennison
    source: Brilliant
    url: https://brilliant.org/wiki/berksons-paradox/

    note: One of the few places where capitalism paradoxically goes against individualism is in the arts.
  - title: Wine & Math, A Model Pairing (2021)
    author: Lars Verspohl
    source: The Pudding
    url: https://pudding.cool/2021/03/wine-model/
    note: This animated explanation of how simple regression models work, using wine quality as a toy problem, was really good. Will definitely use this as an intro for beginners in the future!
  - title: Sell Tax Rights To Make Agents (2021)
    author: Robin Hanson
    source: Overcoming Bias
    url: https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/03/sell-tax-rights-to-make-agents.html
    note: An interesting idea regarding reallocating revenue streams. It seems like a modern version of "tax-farming," but I don't have any critiques at first blush.
  - title: At Least 30,000 U.S. Organizations Newly Hacked Via Holes in Microsoft’s Email Software (2021)
    author: Chris Krebs
    source: Krebs on Security
    url: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/
    note: Email magic links are a great idea, until they are not. The future is 2FA and multi-sig.

    author: Atul Vinayak
    url: https://avinayak.github.io/algorithms/programming/2021/02/19/finding-mona-lisa-in-the-game-of-life.html
    note: A mindblowing Game of Life project. Here I was, thinking my own [@tweetgameoflife](https://twitter.com/tweetgameoflife) was a cool project.
  - title: Israel, Cyprus and Greece agree to link power grids via subsea cable (2021)
    source: Reuters
    url: https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2B015M
    note: At some point in the past, I was super interested in grid operations and clean tech. This piece of news would have sent 19 year old me down a geopolitics and energy rabbit hole.
  - title: "NFTs and CBGBs (2021)"
    author: Alex Danco
    url: https://alexdanco.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-cbgbs-hows-that-for-a-clickbait-title/
    note: The fact that ideas are not owned by any one person and that they’re not priced makes it hard for us to think of them as capital, but a large portion of capital creation comes from intangibles becoming part of the zeitgeist.
  - title: Why did I leave Google or, why did I stay so long? (2021)
    author: Noam Bardin
    url: https://paygo.ghost.io/why-did-i-leave-google-or-why-did-i-stay-so-long/
    note: "You need to be able to answer the \"what have I done for our users today\" question with \"not much but I got promoted\" and be happy with that answer to be successful in Corp-Tech. I guess that's just not me.\n\nThe [followup](https://marker.medium.com/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-startup-within-a-big-company-c3003615f3bc) from Hunter Walk on \"Why There’s No Such Thing as a ‘Startup Within a Big Company’\" was also great."
  - title: Meet Elizabeth Ann, the First Cloned Black-Footed Ferret (2021)
    author: Sabrina Imbler
    source: New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/science/black-footed-ferret-clone.html
    note: This Revive & Restore project is fascinating. It is widely considered to be "a bad thing" when humans mess with the environment enough that we destroy a species and make it go extinct. Is it also bad when we mess enough with it to bring one back, too? Raises interesting questions on how we think of balancing between what is natural and what is man-made. When we intervene to counterbalance previous humans' actions, how far can we go before we're intervening ourselves?
  - title: Slouching Toward Post-Journalism (2021)
    author: Martin Gurri
    source: City Journal
    url: https://www.city-journal.org/journalism-advocacy-over-reporting
    note: This piece by highlights the new equilibrium brought about by the financial incentives of journalism on the internet. Let's get rid of nuance. Whose absolute truth do you believe in? It pairs nicely with [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/business/media/new-york-times-donald-mcneil.html) from Ben Smith, which highlights the same generational divide.
  - title: Silicon Valley isn't full of fascists (2021)
    author: Noah Smith
    url: https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/silicon-valley-isnt-full-of-fascists
    note: "\"...the narrative of a pipeline of fascist ideas from Rationalist blogs to the minds of the powerful people building the future is certainly a juicy one, but it just doesn’t have much evidence to back it up\""
  - title: The Pandemic Disproved Urban Progressives’ Theory About Gentrification (2021)
    author: Jacob Anbinder
    source: The Atlantic
    url: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/anti-growth-alliance-fueled-urban-gentrification/617525/
    note: "1973: \"At a local zoning hearing you might find on one side an elderly dowager who’s voted straight Republican since McKinley and her granddaughter from a commune where they live on nuts and berries. Both are seeking to stop new development.\"\n2021: Same"
  - title: The afghani could split into two (and other possibilities for Afghanistan's currency) (2021)
    author: J.P. Koning
    source: Moneyness
    url: https://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2021/08/two-versions-of-afghani-and-other.html
    note: It's pretty crazy how much every other country depends on the US's blessing to operate in international trade, and how much of a say the US has over other countries' monetary policy.
  - title: Belonging, Home, and National Identity (Podcast, 2021)
    author: Megan McArdle and Russ Roberts
    source: Econtalk
    url: https://www.econtalk.org/megan-mcardle-on-belonging-home-and-national-identity/
    note: "A discussion of Roger Scruton's book on home and nations, _Where We Are: The State of Britain Now_. Lots of interesting questions on personal identity and the ultimate questions of us vs. them that plague our society."
