  - title: Why's that company so big? I could do that in a weekend
    author: Dan Luu
    url: http://danluu.com/sounds-easy/
    note: If there is one thing I have learned over the last year, it is that even small projects require huge overhead when your tolerance for error is small. Building services with acceptable uptime, reliablity, and performance is extremely complicated, if not nearly impossible. "I could do that in a weekend" is a strawman. In fact, I have come to the opposite realization... it is surprising that anything works at all, even when thousands of human hours are invested!

  - title: Deep-Fried Data
    author: Maciej Cegłowski
    source: Idle Words
    url: http://idlewords.com/talks/deep_fried_data.htm
    note: "As usual with Maciej, there are many layers to this essay. The comparisons between libraries and the internet are not new, and his railing against large companies aiding online surveilance are more than expected. Much more interesting are the questions brought up about archiving the modern web - where content is selected, joined, and rendered dynamically per user at load time, with large portions behind walls: What is the point of building a community you don't own? What should be kept for posterity? What is a the point of a site's snapshot without the code that makes it work? What happens when a company dies, or misses, and we go beyond simple link-rot? The conclusion is hand wavey, but the future of the internet is, as Maciej put it, contingent."

  - title: When world leaders thought you shouldn’t need passports or visas
    author: Speranta Dumitru
    source: The Conversation
    url: http://theconversation.com/when-world-leaders-thought-you-shouldnt-need-passports-or-visas-64847
    note: I had never thought about the fact that passports are a recent construct. Obviously, it makes sense, but when I first read it I was baffled that they were a new necessity only a hundred years ago. In historical context, freedom of movement ties very nicely with a lot of themes I have been thinking about related to sovereignty, national identity, shared culture, and their implications. Be it due to globalization, radicalization, or you-name-it-ization, the modern nation-state may be slowly breaking down.

  - title: "Immigration: the right's problem"
    author: Chris Dillow
    source: Stumbling and Mumbling
    url: http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2016/09/immigration-the-rights-problem.html
    note: "To continue the theme of freedom of movement, let's talk immigration policy. In short, Dillow argues that the free market right should support open immigration in much the same way they support free trade. If freedom was something that the conservatives really cared about, they could not be this inconsistent, and they surely would push for more lenient immigration laws than the left. Once again, it is a matter of boundaries, and identity: freedom for whom?"

  - title: Trade Show
    source: Planet Money
    url: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/09/23/495226796/episode-725-trade-show
    note: More of the same. I am on a roll, I guess. It is odd that both US presidential candidates are against trade in this election, so the Planet Money folks compressed a quarter millenium of trade history for us. While superficial, there is a good discussion of The Wealth of Nations, and who benefits from tariffs vis-a-vis open borders and other trade policies. They touch on concentrated benefits and diffuse costs, which we can see across the ladder from regional to supranational deals. I assume the bipartisan anti-trade sentiment in the US is just a blip, and that we'll soon revert to the trend of freer trade.

  - title: Why Are Politicians So Obsessed With Manufacturing?
    author: Binyamin Appelbaum
    source: The New York Times
    note: It is easier to sell people on a safe past than an unsure future. Our brain is hardwired with biases, trained by thousands of years of evolution. It can trick us on false positives and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/opinion/terrorists-bathtubs-and-snakes.html">overblow our fears</a>, or it can make us think that the past was, by its own nature, better than the future. What seems irrational is that no candidate has capitalized on this, realizing that there is a discrepancy between public discourse and the numbers. Soon, some candidate will catch the tailwind instead of falsely promising restoration.

  - title: The Intellectual, Yet Idiot
    author: Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    source: Medium
    url: https://medium.com/@nntaleb/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577
    note: The more I read Taleb, the less I like him. The IYI concept is worth sharing, though, because it is pervasive, and we all fall in the trope at times. "The IYI has been wrong, historically, on [a ton of things,] but he is convinced that his current position is right." The key to ridding one's self of the YI part is to have an open mind, accept errors as they are revealed, and course-correct accordingly.

Just like last week, these were ready yesterday, but the debate talk made me push them for a day. A lot of political content, but the kind that runs deeper than the election cycle's scandal du jour.

It might be time for me to solidify some of these thoughts, and do a write-up of my own.
