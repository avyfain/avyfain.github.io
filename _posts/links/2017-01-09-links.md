  - title: The Ten Year Anniversary of the Apple TV

    note: Ten years ago today, Steve Jobs unveiled two products that could change the world. One did. The other one was the Apple TV. Ben reminds us that how much he's idolized, "it’s worth remembering that even Steve Jobs hedged his bets."

  - title: Grappling With My Family’s Identity in a Post-'Brexit' Europe
    author: Katrin Bennhold
    source: The New York Times
    url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/world/europe/identity-post-brexit-europe.html
    note: It is too easy to start listing groups which you identify with. The author talks about her family, and their identities. What does it mean for her to be European, when she's faced with the contrast between her spouse's Welsh-ness and her own German-ness? What does it mean to have a name, or a passport? More importantly, what will it mean in 10 years, or 20?

  - title: Why read old philosophy?
    author: Katja Grace

    note: I had never thought about how Philosophy is studied in such a different way than pretty much any other discipline. What does this tell us about how we should study science, or how we should teach mathematics?

  - title: Reserves

    note: While obviously biased, Fred has good points about the importance of having experienced venture capitalists backing your company. I knew that reserves, and follow-up rounds, were an important aspect of the business, but its always good to understand the mechanics in a deeper way.

  - title: The Economics of Fake News
    author: Matthew E. Kahn
    source: Environmental and Urban Economics
    url: http://greeneconomics.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-economics-of-fake-news.html
    note: It is easy to draw a matrix to group the cases of what might be fake news, based on the belief of its publisher and its consumer. It is a simple [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix), where the only quadrant we should really worry about is the one where "the supplier knows the story is false but the demander believes the story is true." Kahn exposes important issues about the economic environment in which a market for fake news might arise.

  - title: Entrepreneurship Is Intellectual Immigration
    author: Brad Feld

    note: A quick read. The idea of moving away from your comfort zone, and perpetually moving towards new things is definitely an appealing one to most entrepreneurs.
