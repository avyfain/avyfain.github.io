  - title: This is strictly a business decision
    author: Tim O'Reilly

    note: Incentives rule all our decisions. If the mandate of fiduciary duty is to "maximize shareholder value," that is what any board will do. Whether the "business decision" was correct or not is a question of short-term vs. long-term thinking, discount rates, and how much the company values its employees. When labor is interchangable, this is not a surprising decision. If the well-being of the employees were somehow baked in into the pricing model, there could be a different outcome.

    note: As usual, Evans gives us a lot to think about. Our phones aren't really just phones, and our cameras aren't really just cameras.

  - title: Itâ€™s The Future

    note: Overengineering is a real problem. I need to learn more about this new dev-ops world, and play with Docker et al, but the fact is that to get started, a monolith running on Heroku is more than enough. Scaling will be harder? Yes, but you might actually get something done and sell to real users. Good enough is good enough. Once again, short-term vs. long term incentives.

  - title: All the Leaves are Brown and the Sky is Gray

    source: Accidentally in Code
    note: "Perspective on software engineering impact: Somehow, the industry keeps moving forward as our projects die, 1 by 1. Stay motivated, and learn from your errors."

  - title: The stuff we really need is getting more expensive. Other stuff is getting cheaper.

  - title: "The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority"
    author: Nassim Nicholas Taleb
    source: Medium
    note: A draft of a chapter of Taleb's upcoming book. He argues that asymmetrical rules lead to minorities dictating choices when there are large benefits to a concentrated minority and small diffuse costs among the majority. All his examples are negative, but its not hard to think of how this same effect can affect us positively.

    author: Matt Zucker
    url: https://mzucker.github.io/2016/08/15/page-dewarping.html
    note: Math lets us do some really interesting things. This post presents a relatively simple model that solves a real problem for a real person.

  - title: Firms and Inequality
    author: Claudia Sahm
    url: http://claudiasahm.postagon.com/5v1u3whc2
    note: An analysis on the future of work, and labor compensation. I am not surprised that gains are concentrated in a set of firms, the real question, as Claudia points out, is "is rising worker segregation a sign of reduced competition, greater economic rents, or is it telling us about a change in the nature of production?" My guess? The latter.

  - title: The meaning of trust in the age of Airbnb
    author: Tim Harford
    url: http://timharford.com/2016/08/the-meaning-of-trust-in-the-age-of-airbnb/
    note: The fact that we can walk into a store and exchange a piece of paper for a loaf of bread is a sign of trust. Our economies, and our lives, are all based on trust, and Tim's article explains how important this is in an age where "reputation" becomes currency. Reminded me a lot of Seabright's Company of Strangers.
