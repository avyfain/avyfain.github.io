  - title: "Goodbye, George Bailey: Decline of Rural Lending Crimps Small-Town Business"
    author: Ruth Simon and Coulter Jones
    source: The Wall Street Journal
    note: This is true capitalism at work. At a certain point, the demographics and economics of small towns make it impossible for private businesses to survive. This is why we have governments! Certain human processes are just not profitable, no matter how necessary they are, and we ask the government to step in and do the work to align those incentives, or to put up its own offices instead. A relevant example of this is [USPS](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/29/trump-calls-for-u-s-postal-service-to-raise-amazons-shipping-rates) which is not meant to be a profitable business, but a useful service. Capital flowing out of these towns is inevitable - it is up to local governments to figure out how to provide the necessary services for its people. If that means these little towns should not exist, so be it.

  - title: Nassim Taleb’s Probabilistic Minarchism
    author: Adam Gurri
    source: The Ümlaut
    url: https://theumlaut.com/nassim-talebs-probabilistic-minarchism-c4d3fad683b6
    note: And speaking of little towns, and local governments, here's a piece on Taleb and his views on what governments should and should not do. Essentially, he advocates for small units of governemnt spurring from bottom up local knowledge. His quintessential example of this seems to be the [Swiss canton](https://books.google.com/books?id=QGaMDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&dq=swiss+cantons+taleb&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcqLKuqbPYAhXCh1QKHRQcDvYQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=swiss%20cantons&f=false) system. Having just read Jane Jacobs' [amazing book on city building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities), I have to say I am starting to like these bottom up approaches more and more.

  - title: The Conservation of Coercion
    author: William Wilson
    source: American Affairs Journal
    url: https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/08/the-conservation-of-coercion/
    note: An essay on various forms of social coercion, and how societies with different levels of trust deal with civil issues. Specifically, Wilson discusses how certain societies decrease the required level of trust between individuals on their day to day life, and how this leads to trade-offs between state coercion and social coercion instead of an increase in liberty. I find the topic fascinating, and welcome any and all suggestions on what else I should read about it.

  - title: The Merge
    author: Sam Altman
    url: http://blog.samaltman.com/the-merge
    note: "This is a neat article on humans merging with computers. Altman's take is that this has already started happening (our phones are an extension of ourselves), and the trend is accelerating (double exponential of improving hardware and more people doing AI research). It reminded me of Minsky: \"The serious problems come from having little experience with machines of such complexity that we are not yet prepared to think effectively about them.\" But we've been augmenting ourselves for a long time. There's a striking scene in The Name of The Rose where William explains the use for eye-glasses to other incredulous monks. The glasses quickly become a central object in the story. We've been augmenting our bodies with technology for centuries."

  - title: "Competing with BigCo: 2018 Edition"
    author: Steven Sinofsky
    source: Learning By Shipping
    url: https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/competing-with-bigco-2018-edition-6f475b7be86d
    note: As usual, a great post by Sinofsky. Here he argues against the "end of history" idea that you can't compete against the big platform companies. His piece focuses on Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and (perhaps strangely) Adobe, tearing apart each company's business model and finding the opportunities a newcomer could leverage against them. Everyone's read [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Change-Business/dp/0062060244), and executives at these companies know how to defend against one's own incentives benefitting newcomers, but there are still cracks for startups to get through.

  - title: "The Hidden Player Spurring a Wave of Cheap Consumer Devices: Amazon"
    author: Farhad Manjoo
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/cheap-consumer-devices-amazon.html
    note: "And to keep going with the thread on platform companies, here's one on Amazon enabling lots of new products to come to life. The whole thing is worth reading, but the last paragraph in the article was extremely sharp: \"There is this erosion of what it means to be a traditional consumer product brand,\" Mr. Wingo said. \"In a way, Amazon is providing all this information that replaces what you’d normally get from a brand, like reputation and trust. Amazon is becoming something like the umbrella brand, the only brand that matters.\" Amazing."

  - title: The Amazon machine
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/12/12/the-amazon-machine
    note: It seems like Evans took Farhad Manjoo's [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/cheap-consumer-devices-amazon.html) (the one right above this) and ran with it, taking it an extra few steps. Two pizza teams, and shipping the org chart are not new - I thought the new insight was Evans' third consequence "those atomised teams don’t actually need to work for Amazon." which totally resonates with Manjoo's argument.

  - title: What You Need to Know About the Future of Bitcoin Technology
    author: Subhan Nadeem
    note: This is probably the best survey I've read about BTC's growing pains and the tech being developed to solve them. It doesn't dive too deep, but will expose you to a bunch of ideas, from the Lightning Network to MimbleWimble (yes that's a thing). I'm only bullish on crypto long term because I know the community is working hard to build solutions to these problems, even if vanilla BTC is not the one to succeed.

  - title: The Quest for a Stable Coin
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/168330457810/the-quest-for-a-stable-coin
    note: I recently read the [Basecoin whitepaper](www.getbasecoin.com) which is intriguing, even if a bit too utopic. Having a currency that is pegged somehow to the values in the real economy is a must if we want to transition into a non-fiat world. Paying rent, receiving a salary, or buying bread and eggs with something as volatile as BTC is a non-starter, and one of the tough problems to be solved in the space.

  - title: "Coinbase: The Heart of the Bitcoin Frenzy"
    author: Nathaniel Popper
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/technology/coinbase-bitcoin.html
    note: This feels completely outdated by now (three weeks is a long time in the cryptocurrency world!) but I decided to share it anyway. Scaling a company is hard. Scaling a company at the pace that Coinbase is doing it seems impossible. They will hiccup along for a while, but having even a tiny glimpse of how things work on the inside is quite interesting.

  - title: Google Maps's Moat
    author: Justin O'Beirne
    url: https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat
    note: If you haven't seen O'Beirne's series, you should definitely click through. The first couple of posts he did on the topic came out while I was working in Maps, and honestly some of his points were disheartening. What Google is doing with their geo data is just amazing.

    author: The New York Times
    source: Farhad Manjoo
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/technology/tech-companies-social-responsibility.html
    note: I try not to post more than one article by the same author at a given time, but this one was too good to pass up. Ties nicely with other posts about technology and society I've been sharing over the past few months. I'm looking forward to what scandals the tech sector will give us in 2018.

    note: A great response to [Sam Altman's Post](http://blog.samaltman.com/e-pur-si-muove). I don't buy that SF is not an open minded place.

  - title: What Do You Call a World That Can’t Learn From Itself?
    author: Umair Haque
    url: https://eand.co/what-do-you-call-a-world-that-cant-learn-from-itself-58ae28cefd23
    note: "Something strange about my experience living in the US for the past ~7 years is that the average person I meet in the US (who is FAR from the average US citizen in most respects) is convinced that the US is great, if not the best, in nearly every field. While I don't necessarily agree with some of the arguments and examples given here, I definitely agree with the overall sentiment: people in the US have a misplaced superiority complex, and if things keep going in the direction they're going, they're only going to fall further behind."

  - title: The Peril of Taxing Elite Higher Education
    author: Gregory Mankiw
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/business/the-peril-of-taxing-elite-higher-education.html
    note: Speaking of falling behind, here's Mankiw making some very reasonable arguments for things that we should not be arguing. The higher education system in this country might need some reform, especially on its financing and in the administrative arms race it has triggered in the last couple of decades, but the tax scheme critiqued by Mankiw here is definitely not a solution. Disincentivizing people from going to college is not necessarily a bad idea - we might be subsidizing too much education in some areas - but if that is the goal, there are more direct ways to address it than through taxing endownments.

    author: Harsh Agrawal and Leif Pedersen.
    source: Pixar
    note: Whenever I see stuff like this I regret not taking any graphics courses at school. Modeling reality is very hard. I remember a few years ago learning about how Pixar did hair simulation and finding it fascinating. The Incredibles was one of the first ones in which they seriously took on the physics of moving hair, and then went all out with their physics engine for Brave. In this article they discuss surface modeling, and a new technique they're using to speed up rendering.

    note: Ever heard about this _fake news_ thing? Here's some evidence that, at least in Mexico, it goes deeper than you'd think. I wouldn't be surprised if the exact same thing is happening in the US right now.

    note: A great analysis of labor and immigration in a little town in Alabama during the 90s, including interviews with locals, and research by several economists, who together make very solid arguments for immigration. The real issues are xenophobia and complacency. Don't miss [part two](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/633/our-town-part-two).

    source: EconTalk
    url: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/10/tim_oreilly_on.html
    note: I recently started re-listening to some older episodes of EconTalk, trying to see whether the talking points have changed in the past couple of years. The episode focuses on labor economics, and O'Reilly makes a few good points about changes in how we view labor and reputation today, and how that is changing. Listening to this again made me bump up his book a couple of spots for my to-do in 2018.
