  - title: Metaphors We Compute By
    author: Alvaro Videla
    url: http://alvaro-videla.com/2017/01/metaphors-we-code-by.html
    note: Language matters. Names shape how we think. This is as important in computer science as in any other field. We talk about <i>queues</i> and <i>stacks</i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Etymology">bugs</a></i> and <i><a href="https://twitter.com/Codealike/status/819990490774904833">patches</a></i>, not because we like jargon, but because metaphors are the only way we can get complex ideas across quickly. Communication is the hardest thing about software engineering, and pretty much any human endeavor. Picking the right metaphors can ease our job significantly, and shed light on how others have solved the same problems in the past.

  - title: "San Francisco Asks: Where Have All the Children Gone?"
    author: Thomas Fuller
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/san-francisco-children.html?
    note: "There are a slew of insane facts in this piece. For example, San Francisco has the lowest percentage of children of any of the largest 100 cities in the US. The rate for San Francisco is 13%, for New York is 21%, and for Chicago, 23%, which is also the overall average across the United States. The number of dogs is roughly the same as the number of kids: 120k. There is one additional student enrolled in the public school system for every 100 apartments sold in the city. The public school system has shrunk by 40% since 1970. More than 10 private schools have opened in San Francisco since 2009. This city really makes no sense."

  - title: Dismissing Python Garbage Collection at Instagram
    author: Chenyang Wu and Min Ni
    source: Instagram Engineering Blog

    note: I've never even thought that disabling garbage collection could be a sensible option. It's always fun to see how people can take a deep-dive into the inner workings of their toolchain and come out with this kind of performance boost. Questioning basic assumptions can be a good idea.

  - title: Some Colleges Have More Students From the Top 1 Percent Than the Bottom 60. Find Yours.
    author: The Upshot
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html
    note: "Another great data visualization project out of the NYT's \"analytical journalism\" desk, this time about the relationship between education and economic mobility. Finding your school is really easy. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/northwestern-university\">Here's Northwestern</a>, for example. There are no surprises: the numbers are stark, as expected."

    note: When Brett started posting a bunch of polls on how people use various Python libraries for HTTP requests, I knew he was up to something good.

  - title: The Sound of Silence
    author: Jessica Livingston

    note: This post has been making rounds on tech twitter, and several of the newsletters I follow shared it, too. I wholeheartedly disagree with Jessica here, which is exactly why I wanted to share this. I think Anil Dash's <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/821129187301986306">response</a> summarizes my thoughts well.

The new year has received me with a lot of reading, but of the dead tree variety. I'm halfway with books #3 and #4 of the year by now. I guess an unexpected trip, and an even more unexpected stay in Costa Rica helped too.
