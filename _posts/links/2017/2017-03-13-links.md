  - title: Why All Exchange Rates Are Bad
    author: Timothy Taylor
    source: Conversable Economist
    url: http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2017/02/why-all-exchange-rates-are-bad.html
    note: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity">Trilemma</a> makes it so that whatever policy a government decides to follow, it must be an active choice. Currency manipulation towards a stronger, weaker, more stable, or more volatile currency is a choice, and there is no default. Like everything else in economics, and the world we live in, it is a choice about tradeoffs, and understanding who gains and who loses (and by how much!) is the key to the issue.

  - title: A Big Little Idea Called Legibility
    author: Venkatesh Rao
    source: Ribbonfarm
    url: https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/
    note: 'I am currently reading several books at once, and one of them is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a State</a>. So far, the book has presented a bunch of ideas about the inner workings of what the author calls high modern states. In this post, Rao (who is not the author of the book) summarizes one of the most interesting ideas in the book so far: legibility, or reorganizing society to make it more understandable, and thus more governable.'

  - title: President Trump Wants a Wall? Mexico Is It
    author: Eduardo Porter
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/business/economy/mexico-immigration-border-wall.html
    note: The average American has no clue of how immigration policy and actual immigration patterns work. Understanding how much effort other countries put into helping the US keep illegal immigrants at bay could be helpful in the current climate.

  - title: The Uber Conflation
    author: Ben Thompson
    source: Stratechery
    url: https://stratechery.com/2017/the-uber-conflation/
    note: "2017 gave Uber a rough start. In an unusual post, Ben argues for a change of leadership, focusing on two questions: <i>'Is Uberâ€™s approach to regulation wrong?'</i> and <i>'Is Uber wrong with regards to the specific issue at the center of this controversy?'</i>"

  - title: Brains, Bodies, Minds... and Techno-Religions
    source: a16z Podcast
    url: http://a16z.com/2017/02/23/yuval-harari-from-homo-sapiens-to-homo-deus/
    note: One of my favorite episodes of a16z ever. Touching on the subjects of nationalisim, imagined communities, religion, governments, etc, etc, etc, and how all of these are affected by the rise of technology. I had <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/50bb4830-6a4c-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c.html">shared a related piece from Harari a few months ago,</a> but this podcast episode is way better.

  - title: Crafts, Garicano, and Zingales on the Economic Future of Europe
    source: EconTalk
    url: http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/03/crafts_garicano.html
    note: Having Russ Roberts and one of his guests debate on economic topics is fun. Having him and another three guests? Even better.
