  - title: Bitcoin Exchange Had Too Many Bitcoins
    author: Matt Levine
    source: Bloomberg
    url: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-02/bitcoin-exchange-had-too-many-bitcoins
    note: Last night my cousin asked me, "wait, so I heard bitcoin split, how does that work?" to which I replied, "it is not quite a split," and pointed him to this article. The implications of value creation via new blockchains, and how that value affects the pre-existing base is something I had not thought about until now. It might be that inflation in the world of crypto comes from the creation of new chains. A lot of thinking to do about this. Also recommended, Levine's follow-up ["Bitcoin Forks and Unicorn Fakes"](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-03/bitcoin-forks-and-unicorn-fakes). In general, I've been enjoying Levine's writing a lot lately.

  - title: How BuzzFeedâ€™s Tasty Conquered Online Food
    author: Farhad Manjoo
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/technology/how-buzzfeeds-tasty-conquered-online-food.html
    note: I absolutely _hate_ Buzzfeed's super optimized methods to grab my attention, and knowing that's the goal I try to avoid their non-investigative content. However, Tasty is a great idea, and it is very well executed. I probably have burned hours of my life looking at their cooking videos, and yet not once have I tried one of their recipes (even though I cook almost every day!). There is just something about melting cheese oozing out or chocolate drizzling that makes you want to keep watching.

  - title: "Millennials Unearth an Amazing Hack to Get Free TV: the Antenna"
    author: Ryan Knutson
    source: The Wall Street Journal
    url: https://www.wsj.com/articles/millennials-unearth-an-amazing-hack-to-get-free-tv-the-antenna-1501686958
    note: "I wonder how much of an actual trend this is. I haven't paid for cable since I moved to the US, but I also have no interest in local TV, and I don't think any of my friends do either. Yes, yes, we're not representative, blah blah, but still. The craziest thing about this is people's reaction to the fact that some things are free â€˜No, you canâ€™t live in America for free, what are you talking about?â€™ ðŸ™„"

  - title: This Is How Your Fear and Outrage Are Being Sold for Profit
    author: Tobias Rose-Stockwell

    url: https://medium.com/the-mission/the-enemy-in-our-feeds-e86511488de
    note: The ethics of journalism, and the history of how modern journalism itself came about are interesting topics that I don't know much about. I should work to change that. In the current historical context, it is important to understand how and why the content we consume is created. This post was a little too consparicy theory heavy for me, and yet I thought it was a worthwhile read. As I mentioned to my friend this weekend, I worry about the future of journalism. [Laurene Powell Jobs buying a majority stake in the Atlantic](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/business/media/atlantic-media-emerson-collective-majority-stake.html) or Bezos buying the Post kind of works in the short term, because their ideologies align with mine, and I kind of trust their intent, but tell me that the Koch brothers are buying the WSJ, and my reaction would be different. Creating incentives to keep the editorial integrity while maintaining a viable business is a tough 21st century problem.

  - title: In ICO utopia, there is no division of labour
    author: Izabella Kaminska
    source: FT Alphaville
    url: https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/07/25/2191811/in-ico-utopia-there-is-no-division-of-labour/
    note: A good point about governance, shareholder influence, and, in a way, democracy. If the shareholders are idiots, you end up making bad decisions. But if the shareholders are really smart but skilled in a different area, you end up making bad decisions too.

  - title: The Cycles of Cities

    note: Urban economics and gentrification are recurring topics on this blog. This post doesn't bring much new to the conversation, but the explanation of feedback loops and how the durability of buildings relates to the length of these feedback loops is interesting.

    note: A short post on management. I like DHH's and Basecamp's view of people management. I don't know how closely they follow what they preach, but they seem to assign value to the right things.

    note: Fighting over immigration where there is virtually none. The first act, where they talk to a skeptic who tries to educate himself by reading news online, is just amazing.

    note: Who do we trust in a world where everything is falsifiable? I am really curious about how cryptography and provable mathematics could change this. Companies like [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) are already working on it, but it is far far from mainstream. Even technical people like myself have trouble wrapping our heads around this issue.
