    note: 'Borders, names, in-groups and out-groups, are all arbitrary, and more fluid than we generally think.

    note: This was originally published a full year before the election. Coming here legally is not an easy process. Even though Oman and Costa Rica are so different, I see myself, and echoes of my experience in the US in a lot of these stories.
