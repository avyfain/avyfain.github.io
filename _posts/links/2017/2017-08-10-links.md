  - title: "The End of Typing: The Next Billion Mobile Users Will Rely on Video and Voice"
    author: Eric Bellman
    source: The Wall Street Journal
    url: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070
    note: My experience of technology, and that of most readers of this blog, is one predicated on high speed access, tens, if not hundreds of gigabytes of storage, and last generation processors paired with large amounts of memory. How does the internet work when "fast" means you're streaming over 2G? What do your apps store when the drive on your phone holds only a couple of gigs? How do you find content your when you're illiterate? This article doesn't try (and can't!) answer these questions, but provides data and anecdotes of why they are questions worth asking.

  - title: Our Broken Economy, in One Simple Chart
    author: David Leonhardt
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html
    note: That's trickle down economics for you. Not only is the US economy growing at a slower rate, but it is also growing extremely unequally. Intuitively, these curves should have negative slopes - it is much easier to find an opportunity to grow $100 into $102 than to turn $1M into $1.02M - so what changed in this complex system that lead us to the current state? Rules over wealth and wages are diverging more and more.

  - title: The Fallacy of Biological Determinism
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/163879876635/the-fallacy-of-biological-determinism
    note: "I have tried to avoid the discussion about the [Google memo](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) from last week, so I have read very few articles (and sadly way too many tweets) on the topic. I know I disagree with the author, and reading _N_ think pieces won't change that, so I've tried to shut it off. However, I read almost every post on Continuations, and Albert's take seems like a sober response: we have overcome economic, historical and technological determinism, so it seems logical that even if the biological determinism implied by Damore (the memo's author) were real, we could overcome them with... wait for it... technology!"

  - title: GAFA's org structures as a platform for growth
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/8/9/gafas-org-structures-as-a-platform-for-growth
    note: Organizational behavior is insane. Moving thousands of people towards a common goal is hard, and I hadn't thought about how insane this 10x personnel increase that Evans brings up is. You should listen to the [related podcast](https://a16z.com/2017/08/07/strategy-tactics-large-companies-management), and if you haven't read Sinofsky's [Functional versus Unit Organizations](https://medium.learningbyshipping.com/functional-versus-unit-organizations-6b82bfbaa57), you should probably do that first.

  - title: Modern American elites have come to favour inconspicuous consumption
    note: This article argues that "modern American elites recoiled from accumulating mere goods now that globalisation has made them affordable to the middle class" and are instead now spending their money inconspicously - buying experiences, and high social value items instead. I don't know if I buy the argument, but I guess I'll have to read the book. I have also been meaning to read Veblen for a while, but that's a bit denser.

  - title: Fewer Immigrants Mean More Jobs? Not So, Economists Say
    author: Binyamin Appelbaum
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/us/politics/legal-immigration-jobs-economy.html
    note: Usually I am biased when talking about economics, but this argument wouldn't help me anyway. Letting low skill workers come in help the US, too, as they generate business and grow the pie for everyone else. It's not a zero sum game.

  - title: English language and American solipsism
    author: Branko Milanovic
    source: globalinequality
    url: https://glineq.blogspot.com/2017/08/english-language-and-american-solipsism.html
    note: Is it good for your country that everyone else speaks your language, and that the majority of the population can virtually ignore what's going on outside its borders? I've always argued that it is not. Branko agrees with me. The average American is isolated in their culture. Relatedly, if they can't find things on maps, they're [less likely to want to use diplomacy as a solution.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/14/upshot/if-americans-can-find-north-korea-on-a-map-theyre-more-likely-to-prefer-diplomacy.html) That's bad.

  - title: The Eddie Murphy Rule (Podcast)
    source: Planet Money
    url: http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/08/02/541157778/episode-471-the-eddie-murphy-rule
    note: Among other things, this made me think of the opening chapter of Flash Boys, and how the crazy floors of stock and commodity exchanges are  not what they used to be. Now I want to go watch Trading Places. (Also, Roman Mars on Planet Money? More of that, please.)

  - title: The Stethoscope (Podcast)
    source: 99% Invisible
    url: http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-stethoscope/
    note: Speaking of Roman Mars... I think this episode represents well what I like so much about his podcast. A mix between a history class (who invented the Stethoscope?), a design review (how can you improve upon the original rolled up notebook?), modern culture (why do doctors wear their stethoscopes around their shoulders?), and a bunch of interesting interviews. Worth the 20 minutes.

  - title: "City maps from tourists’ feelings"
    author: Beñat Arregi
    url: http://barregi.com/airbnbmaps
    note: Using Airbnb ratings to visualize a visitor's experience of a city is an interesting idea. Understanding neighborhoods, and social problems (just look at the Tenderloin in the SF visualization!)
