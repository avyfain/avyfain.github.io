  - title: Should Startups Care About Profitability?
    author: Mark Suster
    source: Both Sides of the Table
    url: https://bothsidesofthetable.com/should-startups-care-about-profitability-828250a34a7d
    note: Dealing with the trade offs between profits and growth is one of the toughest problems in business. Suster frames his article as "profits vs. growth," but when he compares companies under different scenarios he's really talking about the decision of raising VC money to fuel growth, not about picking a plowback ratio. The argument put forward in the post is that the calculus of "cash in hand today" vs. "debt today plus a promise of more cash tomorrow" is not a big question in high margin businesses with "winner takes most" outcomes.

  - title: Getting Past the Dominance of the Nation State
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations
    url: http://continuations.com/post/161938064520/getting-past-the-dominance-of-the-nation-state
    note: "This is one of the topics I keep bringing back in conversations with friends, and which I keep getting made fun of for. People forget that the institution of the nation state as we know it is only a couple centuries old, and that it also replaced a seemingly irreplaceable structure. Reading Imagined Communities (see my notes as I go <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Cq-3TWMFbjuHo7lkzNJCGHdjSbminlpoMs8HDY0Zw8/\">here</a>) has convinced me that the status quo is fragile, and while it won't change overnight, there is pressure at both ends to revise it. We're moving towards globalization, while cities gain prominence and develop as smaller localized units that don't necessarily respond to \"the nation\". Countries will be around for a long time, but I am certain that within my lifetime the power balance will have shifted."

  - title: Health Insurance and the R Word (Redistribution)
    author: Albert Wenger
    source: Continuations

    note: Lots of talk these days about insurance these days, for obvious reasons, so here's another post by Wenger.

  - title: Thoughts on Insurance
    author: Aaron Harris
    source: Y Combinator
    url: https://blog.ycombinator.com/thoughts-on-insurance/
    note: This one is less about the politics of it, but the actual mechanics. The business of insurance is one of pricing - the better you are at calculating the likelihood of whatever mishaps you are insuring against, the more money you'll make. Harris explains the various players along the value chain, and discusses how the insurance market is structured.

  - title: Why libertarians should read Marx
    author: Chris Dillow
    source: Stumbling and Mumbling
    url: http://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2017/06/why-libertarians-should-read-marx.html
    note: Dillow lists three reasons. First, he starts with Marx's view of economics as a historical process. Since the economy is "founded upon past injustices" and the "denial of the rights and freedom which libertarians celebrate," the status quo can't be regarded as legitimate by libertarians. Second, he discusses Marx's perspective on property rights, and how they might discourage investment and innovation. Lastly, he posits that Marxâ€™s gripe with capitalism was not that it was unfair, but that it robbed laborers from their freedom. As someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14638503">mentioned on HN a few days ago</a> in the context of a minimum wage discussion, "When a person is desperate, 'voluntary' starts to lose all meaning." I'm not a libertarian, but I should read Marx.

  - title: iPhone Turns Ten
    author: Neil Cybart
    source: Above Avalon
    url: https://www.aboveavalon.com/notes/2017/6/29/iphone-turns-ten
    note: The insanity of transforming the way we interact with technology a second time. "Apple had sold approximately 180M devices since being founded in 1976 (70M Macs and 110M iPods) [...] Apple is on track to sell its two billionth iPhone at some point in 2020."

  - title: There Goes the Gayborhood
    author: Scott James
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/us/gay-pride-lgbtq-gayborhood.html
    note: Hannah has been reading a lot of books on gentrification lately, so we've been discussing the topic more than usual. What is the meaning of gentrification today in these neighborhoods, when the gay population were the original gentrifiers? I live a few blocks away from the Castro, so you could put me in the bad-guys bucket in this story. This is a hot-button issue, and I have no answers on what's the right way to solve it, but I am convinced the real cause is policy, not the people moving in.

  - title: What can developers learn from being on call?
    author: Julia Evans
    url: https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/06/18/operate-your-software/
    note: On call rotations are about aligning incentives. Code that is suspected to have bugs is never merged and pushed to production on a Friday afternoon when the person writing it is on the hook to fix the error over the weekend. In my two years at Apple I have learned a lot about monitoring and logging, and one of the biggest lessons has been to write fool-proof error messages for anyone else in the team to quickly get context and all the information needed to debug without thinking too much. The post is full of other examples.

  - title: The Danger Of Inadvertently Praising Zygomatic Arches
    author: Robert Sapolsky
    source: Edge.org
    url: https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23799
    note: I thought I had posted articles from Edge.org before, but apparently this is a first one! If you haven't visited their website, you definitely should. Every year they post a broad question, and ask people from a wide range of scientific and technical fields to answer it. In 2013, the question was "What *should* we be worried about?" and Robert Sapolsky answered with "What really worries me is that it is so hard for virtually anyone to truly act as if there is no free will." Go read his answer, and then more questions on Edge.

  - title: You Should Do a Story (Podcast)
    source: 99% Invisible
    url: http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/you-should-do-a-story/
    note: 5 stories in 1. A Standard Oil gas station in San Francisco to comply with trademark law, "desire paths" and how user experience beats designers wishes, 50-Hz vs 60-Hz electrical systems, and a whole section on local design solutions, followed by a strange story about street naming.

  - title: A Not-So-Simple Majority (Podcast)
    source: This American Life
    url: https://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/534/a-not-so-simple-majority
    note: Another fight over public governance, funding, and what happens when we can't agree on what the government should and should not provide. This case on public education is insane. The religious side to this story makes me especially angry.

    note: Another fight over public governance, funding, and what happens when... Wait, that's the same description as the post right above, but here we're talking about the federal government and funding scientific research.

  - title: A good walk spoiled (Podcast)
    source: Revisionist History Podcast
    url: http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/11-a-good-walk-spoiled
    note: While the episode is framed as an argument against the game of golf, it really is about the strange taxation status of country clubs in California where the game is played. The reason it is specifically about California is [Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)), and the extremely low property taxes that these clubs pay to the State. Under the proposition, land value is reassessed whenever the majority ownership changes hands, making for a really interesting argument on the nature of ownership under equity membership schemes of the clubs.

    note: Another fun visualization experiment by Fogleman. How many widgets can one pack in a constrained volume? Math can give you the answer.
