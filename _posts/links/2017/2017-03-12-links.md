  - title: Manifestos and Monopolies

    note: It has been interesting to see Ben apply aggregation theory to politics more and more. I agree with the views presented in this article about centralization (or lack thereof), regulation (or lack thereof), and market solutions (or lack thereof).

  - title: "Surfing, metrics and creation: Facebook and Snap"
    author: Benedict Evans
    url: http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/2/17/surfing-users-facebook-and-snap
    note: "Since Snap's S1 came out a couple of weeks ago, everyone has been discussing whether moats exists or not. The fact that their whole thesis revolves around the disintegration of sustained competitive advantages is fascinating. Evans' index fund analogy adds an interesting idea to the mix: Facebook, Instagram, and Google must reflect reality and serve billions, while Snapchat will aim to create N things, each worthwhile to M million people, such that N*M becomes significant while not overtaking the role of the index."

  - title: Segregation Had to Be Invented
    author: Alana Semuels
    source: The Atlantic
    url: https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/segregation-invented/517158/
    note: Not surprisingly, the past is different than we think it was. Thinking of the rise of segregation as a relatively new phenomenon is odd.

    note: A great set of interviews. I constantly think about this topic of where identities overlap and how people view themselves vs. how they are sseen by others. More so these days. Belonging, otherness, and these social dynamics are very intriguing.

This post has been sitting half-baked on my draft list for far too long. In an effort to motivate myself, and to write more, I decided to post it as is and move on. My apologies to the authors of the uncommented links.
