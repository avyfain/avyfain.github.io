  - title: How AI And Crowdsourcing Are Remaking The Legal Profession
    author: Sean Captain

    note: The legal field is not very technologically enabled. As Casetext's Jake Heller points out, "We've all seen this story. Whether it's restaurants or encyclopedias, this is going to be replaced by an open knowledge solution." The question is, which of all these services will win the market (full disclosure, my girlfriend works at Casetext, and I think they are doing great work at making legal data easily available).

Mostly, because people are hard to understand. If you understand people, you'll be a better engineer, better designer, and better manager."

    author: Marco Arment

    note: As Marco says, "...the last thing we all need is for the 'data' economy to destroy another medium." Implied, but not mentioned in the article, is the discoverability problem of podcasts. Finding 10 shows that you generally like is easy. Finding the best episode of those 10 shows is impossible.
