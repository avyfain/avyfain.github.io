  - title: The Car Bundle
    author: Alex Danco
    note: I do not own a car. In this post, Danco explains how cars actually solve many different jobs, all bundled into a single product (he lists commuting, shopping, kids, and recreation, but I'm sure there are more). As more of those jobs are unbundled (i.e., you can shop online, or work from home, or live in a dense city) the overall value of the car bundle diminishes. Danco explores ways in which the bundle could be expanded to other areas, and for the industry to reinvent itself.

  - title: Code is a Palimpsest
    author: Alvaro Videla
    note: I had to look up the word (and it became a Word of the Day). Palimpsests are objects that are written on more than once, with the earlier writing not fully erased, often legible. Code evolves incrementally, one bug at a time, one new feature at a time, usually at the hands of multiple people. Any real piece of software has a lot of history embedded in it's source.

    note: What does it mean to be American? All stories to bind together millions of people as one discrete unit are just that, stories. I'm currently reading Lepore's [These Truths](https://www.worldcat.org/title/these-truths-a-history-of-the-united-states/oclc/1126812923) and I'm learning a lot about the history of the early days of the US, and how those early experiences connect to things that are happening today. I very much recommend the book, but if you want a taste this essay is a good starting point, and if you want a taste of a taste, there's also a really good [interview on the EconTalk podcast](http://www.econtalk.org/jill-lepore-on-nationalism-populism-and-the-state-of-america/).

  - title: Build institutions, not apps
    author: Mark Lutter
    note: A response to Andreessen's piece below. Recently I've been reading a lot of critiques of the lack of involvement of technologists in politics. This is one of the better ones. _Institution_ is a squishy word. Companies are institutions. They establish a set of conventions and a social context within which a product is developed. Cities and states are institutions, formed by smaller institutions. The technique of how to run a high growth startup that pumps out code does not translate into running a government, but that doesn't mean there aren't lessons to be shared.

    author: Ned Batchelder
    note: If you're writing Python, having good tests matters a lot more than if you're coding in a statically typed language like Java or Go. The language constrains you less, and it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot. You're already testing anyway, but doing it manually. Here, Ned provides a really good end to end overview of how to structure your code to make testing easier, and how to think about testing more generally as you develop your codebase.

While many of the companies listed on this post are constantly critiqued for their extractive practices, in the end the people who sell their labor or their products on those platforms are better off because those platforms exist. I don't buy the "level playing field" point, but it surely is more level than it used to be.

  - title: "Transcending capitalism: three different ways? "
    author: Branko Milanovic 
    source: Global Inequality
    note: "What comes after capitalism? Milanovic puts forth three possible models that can help us think through this question. First, he shares an idea from John Roemer's [\"What is socialism today\"](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/Images/Programs/Economics/EcoSlider/Roemer-What-is-socialism-today-GC-Econ-Seminar-Feb-3-2020.pdf), which uses concepts from game theory to argue that as societies get richer less individuals behave in narrowly profit-motivated ways, instead opting for more solidaristic behaviors based on some higher ideal that leads to cooperation. Next, he brings up Thomas Piketty's [Capital and Ideology], which argues we should have a two tier system, where companies beyond a certain threshold would trigger a workers shareholding arrangement that severely limits the stake any one person can have, while distributing a significant portion of the value to workers. This system would still allow for small and medium enterprises, maintaining incentives for innovation and value creation in a chiefly capitalist environment, while simultaneously altering the power relations between labor and capital. Lastly, Milanovic brings up his own view, one which is less ideological, and more an extrapolation of the relative scarcity of capital decreasing over time. In a world with a glut of capital, individuals can become entrepreneurs by borrowing said capital at very attractive rates without giving up control to capital owners. This last idea has a lot more Silicon Valley idealism than I'd usually expect from a generally left-leaning Marxist blogger, but I can see it."

Growth for the sake of growth, and profits for the sake of shareholders are not tenets of capitalism set in stone. Leaders can decide to make their companies true to a mission, and true to a predefined set of values, and invest their resources accordingly.

    note: An in depth profile of one of the foremost translators of Chinese science fiction, and one of the authors he worked with. The story describes Ken Liu's experience translating Liu Cixin’s Three Body Problem, and the political minefields that the translator had to traverse to convey the underlying message of the original work to a group of readers that would otherwise have no access to the stories. While I read the book, and enjoyed it, not knowing Chinese history makes it really hard to grasp the nuance and the references as explained in this article, but, honestly, from my perception of how Chinese censorship works I'd be surprised if translating books like this one wasn't a massive effort.

How do you make it so that people seek out this knowledge instead of making it a coercive mandate? Like, we could push for legislation that makes progress studies part of the history or civics curriculum, but that is a chicken and egg problem.

The fact that profits are a simple feedback loop we can exploit doesn't mean that _everything_ should be for profit, but as he points out, money aligns interests and keeps people honest.

    author: Ben Thompson
    source: Stratechery
    note: The internet as a whole is built around a protocol where no one trusts each other by default. Instead of having a centralized system to tell us what is or is not worth trusting, there is a (mostly) decentralized system that allows each participant to verify the source of the data they're receiving. This kind of decentralization means that good and bad things alike are out there, and no one can remove it at the source. Here, Thompson makes an analogy between misinformation on social media and packets being routed on the internet - it's not just access to misinformation that has increased, but access to really high quality viewpoints, too. The verification is on us.

That doesn't make the data any less interesting.

At some point, CEOs, coaches, leaders and stakeholders need to pick values, and stick to them. Historically, sports are one of the few spaces that are generally seen as politically neutral, even though they are nowhere close to that. There's money in sports, and in global markets, there's politics in money, therefore money and politics in sports.

To a much lesser degree I live this situation, as I am a near-market rate tenant in a really old building in San Francisco. Every once in a while, one of my neighbors asks me to email our landlord, to ask him to fix small issues that he'd ignore if they came from someone who's been living here for decades, and who pays a fraction of what I pay.

Representation matters, if anything, because it allows us to adapt and move our mirrors to new angles."

    author: Roberta Smith
    source: The New York Times
    url: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/arts/design/george-washington-san-francisco-murals.html
    topic: History
    note: Especially relevant today. We can paint over murals, or destroy statues, but that teaches the wrong lesson. Today, a majority can believe _A_ was a bad guy, for doing _X_. At some point in the past, people thought otherwise, and they thought that _A_ was great for _Y_,  perhaps even despite _X_! Much like we changed our minds, generations to come likely will as well. The problem, in my view, lies in believing we are at the end of history, the most enlightened we'll ever be, and that the ideas we hold dear today are the non plus ultra. If we destroy the historical artifacts, whether that is monuments, books, pieces of art, newspaper articles, or murals down the memory hole, there's no going back.

Three out of the nine companies discussed in Webb's book are in China. If her vision of "technology warping humanity" becomes real, I truly hope it is technology whose values I agree with.

Framing the discussion through the lens of classical economics, as well as film, and their everyday experiences, Klein and Roberts discuss the ways in which commerce and capital can help us guide us.

What is it that makes live things, well, alive? Riskin's book discusses the analogies that we've used to explain this idea as a way to navigate the history of science, and the history of our thought about ourselves.

    source: Econtalk
    note: Capitalism is not inherently amoral, but the incentive structures that arise from capital accumulation can lead people to make decisions that are better for themselves while not better for anyone else. Therefore, we can't depend on good people doing the right thing, and instead we need to bake those incentives against cronyism and regulatory capture into the market structures themselves. Munger and Roberts are not short on ideas of how to do that.

This conversation takes that utilitarian idea and expands on it into the effective altruism movement, and more generally into the question of how we can maximize our impact for the betterment of society.

    author: Russ Roberts and Jacob Stegenga
    source: Econtalk
    note: This one is controversial. Most medical treatments fail to achieve their goals, but are still provided as people hope they will be the lucky ones who do get the desired effects. This has a cost on society, but more importantly it has a cost on the patients, who might have been better off without the treatment, whether directly because of unintended consequences of a procedure or indirectly because of the financial impact of their decision on their futures. Anything where cost-benefit analysis is applied to human life is extremely hard to discuss, but Stegenga brings up all sorts of good examples from pharma, surgery, and medicine more generally. Even if you're not persuaded, and I am not sure that I fully am, these are the kinds of questions people should be asking themselves more often.

In his view, it is very likely that humans can create technology that's so powerful that it can destroy the world. You can think of nuclear war, genetic engineering gone awry, or in a much more present-day kind of scenario, our world gets so connected that a pandemic wipes us out easily. This and more in a very interesting conversation.

    note: One of the instances where imperfect markets lead to surprisingly bad outcomes. Dollar stores are ubiquitous in the rural US, and have more market power than the average local grocery store. Selling fresh produce is expensive, especially compared to the kind of high margin non-perishable items that a dollar store can carry. Since people try to save a buck, they end up buying all the low-margin items at local stores, and the high margin ones at the dollar store chains, which eventually leads the local grocers to close shop. This is an adjacent problem to that of food deserts, but perhaps even more perverse.

    note: A lot of this episode resonated with me, and how I choose what to read or listen to. I'm excited about the viability of ideas that play with the “negative interest rates of the attention economy.”

  - title: Inside Apple Software Design (Podcast)
    author: Ken Kocienda and Frank Chen

    note: Even though I have been working at Apple for 5 years, I don't feel very exposed to this kind of thinking. The cycle of client development permeates everything in the company, and we all run on the yearly release of new features with the next OSs. However, my role leading a software engineering team building analytics tools means that the stuff that Kocienda proposes goes completely against the principles our team pushes for. It often feels like we swim upstream, but the symbiosis works out.

    topic: TV, Film, Music, Media
    note: Listening to Sonal and co. talk about the evolution of podcasts, and the practical problems yet to be solved (tooling for creators, search, analytics, discoverability, biz models, etc) makes me curious and excited about the future. So many interesting pieces of the business model puzzle that still need to be figured out!

    note: A lot of our decision making processes are based on the idea of voting occurring in a single snapshot, whether that is for boardrooms or national elections. What kinds of structures can emerge once we remove a few constraints?

<div class="post" id="top">
  <p>It's been a while since the last one of these, so here I am, dropping ~200 links on you, hoping that at least one or two seem interesting. It's a very non-exhaustive list of interesting stuff I've read/listened to since early 2019, but I tried to focus on evergreen content.</p>
  <p>Much of the stuff below had been stored in drafts of a <em>links post</em> for over a year, but some of it I actually collected in the past couple of days by going through my tweets, conversations with friends, and my Pocket feed. Putting this together involved a lot of scrolling. I was honestly surprised by how much content from the NYT I had bookmarked, as well as how little science and programming related articles I had kept in my list.</p>
  <p>To make navigation easier, I've roughly categorized things below, although there is a lot of overlap between the topics.</p>

  <p>Anyway, enjoy, and let me know which ones I missed!</p>
  <h3>Index</h3>

<p>Whoa, you made it to the end!</p>
