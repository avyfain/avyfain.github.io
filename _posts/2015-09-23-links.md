I am amazed by the fact that [Caltrain ridership tracks the Nasdaq](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/09/18/silicon-valleys-economic-indicator-caltrain-ridership/). This is the kind of relationship that I would never think about on my own, but once I read it, it clicked and makes perfect sense. I wonder if similar correlations can be found for other cities and their public transit.
