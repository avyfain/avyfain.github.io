## Hi, I'm Avy!

<img src="{{ site.image_path }}avy.png" alt="avy" width="150px" height="150px">

I'm a recent graduate from Northwestern University, with a degree in Integrated Engineering and Economics. I work as a software engineer at Apple, building data visualization and project management tools. I've previously worked with [Opternative](http://www.opternative.com), [Enova Financial](http://www.enova.com), [Juntos Global](http://www.juntosglobal.com) and the [Kellogg Research Computing Lab](http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing).

Way too much time of my free time is spent reading random stuff online. Sometimes, I actually read books, too. Lately, I've been reading about the [natural history of economic life](http://www.amazon.com/The-Company-Strangers-Natural-Economic/dp/0691146462) and the inner workings of [human cognition](http://www.amazon.com/The-Society-Mind-Marvin-Minsky/dp/0671657135), and have not been able to put down this one [book about baboons](http://www.amazon.com/Primates-Memoir-Neuroscientists-Unconventional-Baboons/dp/0743202414).
