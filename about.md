## Hi, I'm Avy!

This is me circa 1995. Not much has changed.

The photo above was taken in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, where I was born and raised. I've lived in the US for the past ~8 years, first in Chicago, studying engineering and economics at Northwestern University, and now in San Francisco, where I work as a software engineer on Apple's Siri Search team.

Way too much of my free time is spent reading, both online and off. This blog is the place where I compile my favorites for others to indulge (including future me). It's way easier for me to take a good photo than to write a good essay, but I'm working on improving both. I'm interested in complexity, emerging behavior, and the systems that humans build to tame the two.
