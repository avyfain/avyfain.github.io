This site is hosted and served on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with some assets coming out of S3, and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) in front. It is built with the help of a lot of Open Source Software, and free services.

  * [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is my static site generator.
  * [Hyde](hyde.getpoole.com) is the base theme, although I've tweaked it a lot.
  * [Compress](http://jch.penibelst.de/) is the tool that makes all my html small.
  * [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) and [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round?selection.family=Varela+Round) are the fonts you're reading. I used Mario Ranftl's [google-webfonts-helper
](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts) tool to self-host them.

My [photos](/photos) are shot on a Canon 6D paired with a Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 or a 35mm f/2. Recently I got myself a 70-200 f/4, which I'm still learning to use. When I started out, I was using a hand-me-down Canon XSi that I got from my sister in law Einat, usually with a Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM pancake lens. The light editing I do happens on Photos.app, but I'm testing out Lightroom, too.

Hannah almost always proof-reads my posts, and corrects my broken English.

I stole this domain from my brother Max.
