Today, out of curiosity I went back to [the first post](http://avc.com/2003/09/my_first_post/) in Fred Wilson's AVC's archive. I was surprised by the terseness, and the simplicity. 

Maybe that's all I need to start writing more. Lowering the bar I set for myself. If Fred could do it, way back in September 2003, why shouldn't I?
